<p>With palms together,</p><p>Lately I've been thinking about community or the lack thereof,&nbsp; It used to be that community was essential to our survival and perhaps it still is, yet as a result of the pandemic, our sense of community seems in its death throes or at least in major transition. We are still afraid to come together live and in person. i believe this negatively affects social cohesion, which in my mind is quite threatening to our communal welfare, let alone our democracy.&nbsp;</p><p>In an earlier paper I contemplated a social structure divided into two groups: "boxies" and "riskies," falling along the introvert/extravert psychological scheme. I suggested that introverts were, essentially, more comfortable in the society wide lockdowns than were the more extravert riskies. For the latter, the lockdowns were uncomfortable in the extreme.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>.</p>
