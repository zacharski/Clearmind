With palms together,<br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />The recent comments regarding reducing violence have been floating around my mind over the last several days. This is neither good nor bad. When we have something on our minds, in one sense, means that we are paying attention to something. Yet, in another sense means we are being distracted by thought and, therefore, not seeing clearly.<br /><br />Thinking about reducing violence and being peace will not make it happen, just as thinking about enlightenment will not bring it to your mind.<br /><br />Practice realization, as Master Dogen points out, is just practice. One thing already containing the other, but (in a very special sense) in motion. There is no thinking about peace. There is just peace. There is no thinking about reducing or eliminating violence, there is just being the elimination of violence, period.<br /><br />We accomplish this through being these things.<br /><br />Just as in any other aspect of our practice, right understanding provides a clear framework for all that follows. Clear mind is right understanding. From clear mind comes right thought, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and meditation.<br /><br />To be "right" means to be from the center: direct expressions of buddha-nature. This is non-equivocating compassion.<br /><br />So, when we set out to bring about peace, we are already mistaken. Just as polishing a tile will not make a mirror. Just as sitting zazen will not make a buddha. We are buddha from the beginning.<br /><br />Do not set out. Just be.<br /><br />A deep bow to each of you.
