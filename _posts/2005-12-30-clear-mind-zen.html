<div id="RTEContent"><div id="RTEContent">With palms together,</div><br />Good Evening All,<br /><br />Today I met with the priests that comprise most of the Board of Daibutsuji.  We discussed many things, schedules, sangha needs, etc. But most importantly, we agreed to establish our own school of Zen Buddhism in America, severing our links to Sotoshu in Japan.<br /><br />Our school will be called, "Clear Mind" and our focus will be on the development of Zen as an everyday practice. Our hope is to redefine religion from its western sense of worship of a diety to a sacralization of daily life.<br /><br />We will practice from a Soto tradition, but not be limited to it. <br /><br />Zen in America must become a uniquely American experience and practice. To do so means we must leave Japan to the Japanese and walk our own path.<br /><br />I look forward to this experience and would appreciate your thoughts.<br /><br />Be well,<br /><br /></div><br /><br />May All Beings Be Free From Suffering<br /><br />So Daiho-roshi<br />On the web at http://www.daihoji.org/ and http://daihoji.blogspot.com/ <p><hr size="1"><br />Yahoo!
