With palms together,<br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />This morning after sorting out my pharmacy for the week (a seemingly endless job anymore), I have been busy writing some changes to our websites, giving instructions to create a new website in honor of Matsuoka-roshi, our dharma grandfather, and thinking about Clear Mind Zen.<br /><br />But thinking about is not good.<br /><br />Thinking about takes us away from clear mind and brings us to thoughts, feelings, and other clouds over the water.<br /><br />Instead, we should just be clear mind.<br /><br />Vowing to see things as they are, I rise and engage the world. This means I vow to engage myself as I encounter myself in the world through my interactions with others. Each time we encounter another we are facing ourselves.  We see something of ourself in the face in front of us: love, need dislike, anger, fear, whatever.  Each is an opportunity to practice and make our world a better place.<br /><br />This afternoon my Teacher, Hogaku-McGuire-roshi and his wife, Shin Getsu-roshi will visit us for dinner here at our new apartment.  I am pleased.<br /><br /><br />Just putting one foot in front of another is the best way.<br /><br />Be well,
