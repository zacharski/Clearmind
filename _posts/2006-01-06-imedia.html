<div id="RTEContent">With palms together,</div><br />Good Morning Sangha,<br /><br />Last night was troubling. For the last three years we have lived without television and now we have one sitting in our living room. I found myself watching it.<br /><br />So many words.  Such silliness. Mindless laughter over stupid behavior. Violence framed as the pinnacle of drama. The pictures of people happy over the illness of a person are disturbing. Fundamentalism in whatever arena is disturbing. Pat Robertson is disturbing. The people who seek counsel from him are disturbing.<br /><br />Yesterday on our drive to Mexico, we listened variously to CNN, Fox, and the BBC on our XM Satellite Radio. Interesting the dramatic difference between the American stations and the BBC.  We are fortunate, I think, to have access to the BBC. And to PBS and to NPR.<br /><br />Still, the silence of the Refuge is so appealing.  Few words.  No phosphorescent dots on a screen reflecting or distilling a violent, obsessed world, always attempting to sell through misery and our perverse need to see it.<br /><br />Thank goodness for the process nature of things.  Change is one thing I count on to relieve my suffering.<br /><br />Be well
