<div id="RTEContent">With palms together,</div><br />Good Morning Sangha,<br /><br />Yesterday's Zazenkai was a good practice.  We sat three periods in the morning, walked a half mile to have lunch, returned, sat again two periods, cleanerd the Zen Center, sat again two periods and went home.<br /><br />There was nothing special about this day. The opportunity to mindfully refill the lamps, dust the butsudon, sweep the floors, was ordinary. Sitting on the cushion was ordinary. Bowing was ordinary.  Lighting incense was ordinary., Chanting the Heart Sutra was ordinary.  Reciting the Four Great Vows was ordinary.<br /><br />We just did these things, as they came time to be done. When we go through a day like this we are buddhas.<br /><br />A reminder: Sunday Zazen begins at 10:00 AM this morning.<br /><br />Be well
