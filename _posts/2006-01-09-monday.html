<div id="RTEContent">With palms together,</div><br />Good Morning Everyone!<br /><br />Over the weekend we had many wonderful things happen. Saturday I spent the day in meditation at the Zen Center. Sunday I did meditation at Zen Center on Sunday morning. And in the afternoon we were given a welcome to Las Cruces party at a friend's home.<br /><br />We are settling into our community here. It is very different from our life in the mountains. I am finding myself struggling a little to get into a routine.  I love routine.  Routine grounds me.  I take great comfort in it.<br /><br />Here in the city, there are so many competing interests: bookstores, movies, grocery stores, the Zen Center, the Temple Beth El, friends, theatre. I want to run.  I want to workout.  I want to get more involved in the local peace movement.  I want to be inservice to others.<br /><br />And there it is: I.<br /><br />For a moment, relaxing would be a good thing.  Taking a nice deep breath.  Noticing the beauty and wonder of this very moment, of this very edge. There is nothing to do but to take the next step and take it fully.<br /><br />My faith is that when "I" do this, "I" will lose its much of its power to lead me around by the nose. Values have an opportunity then to arise and be my guide. So, there at the intersection of Is and Ought are my values: compassion and service, health and fitness, community and family.<br /><br />Be well
