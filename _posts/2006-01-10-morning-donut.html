<div id="RTEContent">With palms together,</div><br />Good Evening Sangha,<br /><br />We are returned from Mexico.  At the border we were asked to pull around the back of the Inspection Station and exit the truck.  Then this rather massive machine was driven past our truck.  Apparently, it was a large X-ray machine that scanned the truck for illegals or whatever.<br /><br />Another couple was standing next to us.  There was a baby in a carrier sitting on the pavement next to them.  We took a peek to see a most beautiful little baby girl with lovely dark eyes and black hair.<br /><br />Once the Very Large Machine passed us, we were let go. About a few miles up the road we were stopped once again and inspected.  A nuisance, but I suppose it is necessary to keep us safe from all those dangerous migrant laborers.<br /><br />Entering the dentist's office we were confronted by the heavy antiseptic scent of cleanser.  The office was just openning and the cleaning crew was just wrapping up. The receptionist who doubles as a dental technician wanted a donut.  Fortunately there was a bakery across the street.  I walked over and bought four donuts. The technician was very pleased. <br /><br />My Little Honey's mouth is now full of brand new crowns...lots of them.  She is delighted.  I am delighted.  We ate none of the donuts.<br /><br />Sometimes it is just taking care of the business of taking care of ourselves that is the most wonderful thing we can do.  Other than, perhaps, reading a few of Master Dogen's essays from the Shobogenzo in a dentist's office on a dirt road in a small Mexican border town. And I suspect that was my morning donut in itself.<br /><br />Be well <p></p>
