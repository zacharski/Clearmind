<div id="RTEContent"><span style="font-family:Courier New;">Ten ox-herding pictures<br />Verses Composed by KAKUAN Zenji<br /><br />Stage 4<br />Seizing the ox<br /><br />Introduction<br />For a long time he has been living in obscurity in the countryside;<br />today you have met him.<br />Because he enjoys his former situation so much, it is difficult to<br />drive him out.<br />He cannot stop loving the fragrant grasses;<br />his stubborn will is still strong and a wild spirit remains.<br />If you wish to make him pure and obedient, you must apply the whip.<br /><br />Verse<br />You have exhausted all your faculties to take hold of him.<br />Because his spirit is strong and his strength abundant,<br />it is difficult to rid him of his habits.<br />Sometimes he goes to the top of the high plain.<br />Other times he resides in clouds and smoke.</span><br /><br />So Daiho:<br /><br />Orgasm is like that, so is riding as motorcycle at 90 mph without the headlights at midnight.<br /><br />We sit in silence and in a moment everything is nothing.<br />Our eyes flicker.<br />Pulses are just pulses.<br /><br />Impulse and impatience are the great teachers subverting themselves.<br />In the end, we must grab them by their short hairs and speak.<br />Enough!<br /><br /></div>
