Even when we are sad, we should make an effort to smile. Our world has enough pain and suffering, frowns and crying faces. Our practice is to add joy to the universe and we do this with a simple smile. </p><p></p><p>Each day practice smiling. Each day behave as if you are a smiling buddha. In reality, you are, regardless of how you feel that day. When you take on the smile, the universe smiles with you, even if it is in a lot of pain.</p><p></p><p>The dog barks: smile. The postman brings a bill and you have little money: smile. Someone treats you with disrespect: smile. </p><p>Such practice displaces bad feeling. New, good feeling then has an opportunity to grow. Pie in the sky, you say? Hmmm. I like pie.</p><p></p><p>Be well,</p><p></p>
