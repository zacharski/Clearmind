<div id="RTEContent">With palms together,</div><br />In the middle of normal, today:<br />Zazen, breakfast, banking,<br />grocery shopping, laundry,<br />house cleaning,<br />writing and emailing.<br />The laundry is folded,<br />hung, and otherwise<br />put away. <br />The groceries<br />are put away.<br />And our Shabbos dinner<br />is being prepared.<br />I have incense lit<br />in the Zendo<br />with the door open<br />so that the fragrance<br />of sandlewood<br />moves through the rooms.<br />Countless smiles:<br />Life is stillness in motion.<br /><br />Be well
