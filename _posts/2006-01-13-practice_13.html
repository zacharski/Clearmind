<div id="RTEContent">With palms together,</div><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />There is a cold front moving through the desert.  Yet the sun warms the air quickly. Just so, sitting facing the wall.<br /><br />Zazen is a burning practice.  It melts away the self. And as it does, all things become cool springs, welcomed, often devoured as they arise.<br /><br />We simply eat.<br /><br />To sit Zazen on a regular basis is to stregnthen our effort.  It is a practice of the Excellences and the Eightfold Noble Path all rolled into one cucumber sitting upright on a bed of lettuce.<br /><br />We simply eat.<br /><br />Soon it is time to rise.  Just as when we fill our bellies at the table, we should rise slowly.  We should continue holding our mind in everpresent stillness, a sort of stillness in motion, that takes us through our day, concluding once again on the great cushion.<br /><br />Please enjoy the warmth and the practice it yields.
