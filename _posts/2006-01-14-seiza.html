<div id="RTEContent"><div id="RTEContent">Sitting seiza our hands held in gentle repose, the heart and body settles as we open to the universe. Seiza is a traditional knelling position.  Often used by women and used in Tea Ceremony, it possesses great elegance on the one hand, and positions the body in a receptive form, allowing a gentle face to emerge, on the other.</div><br />To sit seiza, simply kneel.  Pleace your hands in the Cosmic mudra, keep your shoulders straight and open, tuck your chin slightly.<br /><br />You may use a zafu on its side for support or a specially constructed seiza bench.<br /><br />I find sitting this way is an excellent tool in assisting me to get in deep touch with the feminine within.  It is difficult to feel aggressive feelings in this pose. Much like gassho assists us in opening ourselves to compassion and releases anger, seiza opens us to receptivity and relaxes defenses.<br /><br />As always, when you sit, sit with dignity.<br /></div>
