STAGE 7<br />OX FORGOTTEN, PERSON REMAINING<br /><br />Introduction<br />In the dharma there is no duality; the Ox is the foundation.<br />It may be compared to the rabbit and the snare;<br />it is expressed in the difference between fish and weir.<br />Like gold coming from ore, like the moon emerging from behind the <br />clouds.<br />The Single Way of cold light has been shining<br />ever since the time of Ion beyond the kalpas.<br /><br />Verse<br />You have mounted the ox<br />and already reached your home in the mountains.<br />The ox is gone and the person has nothing more to do.<br />Though the morning sun has already risen three bamboo lengths,<br />he dreams on.<br />The whip and the halter, no longer of use, are hung up in the stall.<br /><br /><br />So Daiho:<br /><br />Opening my eyes this morning, I thought of you. My dogs, Tripper and Pepper waited patiently, the coffee was made, bows made, the incense was lit. Nothing here is apart from one another.  You, I, dogs, coffee, incense, and all of the actions are the same without any distinction.  Distinction is an illusion of mind.<br /><br />These things were always there and will always be here.  And more, there really is no here or there, then and now. We call this our original nature. Our original nature is our continuous nature, our perpetual nature. Once understood, once attained, we realize it's true nature.<br /><br />So, then, of what use language? So, then, what use zafus, robes, dog leashes, coffee?<br /><br /><br />May All Beings Be Free From Suffering
