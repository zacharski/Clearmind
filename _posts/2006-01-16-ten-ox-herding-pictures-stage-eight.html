<div id="RTEContent"><div id="RTEContent">STAGE 8<br />PERSON AND OX BOTH FORGOTTEN<br /><br />Introduction<br />Ordinary feelings have fallen away, thoughts of holiness are all empty.<br />We should not linger where there is Buddha; we should pass quickly by<br />where there is no Buddha.<br />If we do not stick to either, it will be difficult for a thousand <br />eyes to perceive us.<br />For myriad birds to carry flowers is a shame all around.<br /><br />Verse<br />Whip, tether, person and ox - all are empty.<br />The blue sky spreads out far and wide, it cannot be communicated.<br />On a red-hot oven, how can there be any place for snow?<br />Having come this far, you understand the intention of the patriarchs.<br /><br /></div>So Daiho:<br /><br />We chant the Wisdom Heart Sutra, all bowing with the sound of the bell.  We adjust the flowing robes and sit facing the wall. We rise and walk, feeling each footfall, each stiff muscle relax.  We sit again.  We sip our tea so graciously served. We listen to the Dharma, incomparably profound and minutely subtle. When we do this awake, there is no room for even a single thought, not a single feeling. The oven is, indeed, hot.<br /><br />Practicing like this there is no practice and no practitioner.  There is simple awareness in motion. The tools are just tools and are no longer necessary. But because we are buddhas we continue: through time and space there we are; one, all, none.<br /><br />Just so, we get up in the morning and great the day.  We say hello to the kitty, the dogs, the coffee pot.  We sit zazen, we wash our faces, clean our teeth. We go to work, driving, walking, running, sitting, eating, talking. Done fully and completely, there is no room for wobbles. <br /><br />As the present moment yield of all causes and conditions before, lizards now speak and slime walks. The combustion of creation is settled in form. And in process. And in form. And in process.<br /><br />In this place, beginning and end have no meaning.<br /><br />Be well.<br /><br /><br /></div>
