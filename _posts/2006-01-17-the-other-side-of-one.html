<div id="RTEContent">With palms together,</div><br />Good Morning Sangha,<br /><br />This morning I awake to see I killed an old man last night.  Strapped his ass down and filled him full of poison.  I also stood outside the death chamber as a silent witness. And slept in my bed, comfortable and thoughtless as to what I was doing.<br /><br />When we say we are one, what do we mean?  When we say we are all buddha-nature waiting to crack out of that vast emptiness we could call a cosmic egg, what does this mean?<br /><br />If we are all one, then we are all killing, all witnessing, all crying, all starving, all sleeping, all fucking, shitting, eating, and whatever else we human beings, mice, worms, cats and dogs do. So, then, what is our responsibility?<br /><br />When you get up this morning, that question is your practice.<br /><br />Be well,
