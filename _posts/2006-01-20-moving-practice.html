<div id="RTEContent">Good Morning Everyone,</div><br />There is Zen of Stillness and there is Zen of Movement. In the Zendo we practice both: zazen and kinhin. There is a reason for this. We talk so much about the ideas of Zen. We talk about the paramitas, the precepts, sitting zazen, etc. In spite of all the words, Zen is not about them. The talk is about walking the walk. In this case, the walk is literal.<br /><br />Today is the last day of my modified training schedule which includes a longish run/walk. Also today I will work my legs with weights. Beginning Monday morning my workouts will change, upping the volume to several sets of heavy weight Monday through Friday each day targeting a major muscle group: chest/back, arms/shoulders, legs, chest/back, arms/shoulders. I will do a short treadmill run following each of those workouts and on Tuesdays and Thursdays go outside for a longer run.  Saturday will be rest and Sunday will be my Long Slow Distance run day.<br /><br />Daily hard and vigorous exercise is a good Zen practice. We enter this practice with an open mind, accepting of our body and its limitations, as well as its need to be stressed. We were built to move. Our muscles and cardiovascular system demands it; our digestive system works better with it; and our central nervous system has an opportunity to integrate with our total body.<br /><br />It is challenging for us to begin and stay with this practice.  We find all sort of reasons not to do it: time, pain, lack of inclination, ideology, fear.  The same reasons we use not to sit zazen. Or do other practices which will nurture both our bodies and the planet.<br /><br />Let me encourage each of you to begin a moving practice today. Walk, bike, lift, play: it really doesn't matter.  Just do this practice with right concentration and right effort. Being mindful in each movement we increase our awareness of, and integration with, our mind and body. As we progress we will feel stronger, healthier, and more confident.<br /><br />Be well.
