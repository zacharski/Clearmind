Good afternoon All,<br /><br />This message was posted to the Zen Forum at Yahoogroups by my friend Al.  I wanted to share it with you because I believe he hits the nail right on the head. When did it become cool to be so mean, rigid, and unwilling to listen to a diffeent point of view?<br /><br />My wife and I chanced upon a few minutes of Jerry Springer the other day.  My goodness.  And the "discussion" by the t.v. news talking heads isn't any better.<br /><br />I hope we can dig our way our of this craziness.<br /><br />Be well.<br /><br /><b><i>Al &lt;actionheroes@earthlink.net&gt;</i></b> wrote:<br /><blockquote class="replbq" style="PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: #1010ff 2px solid">To: &lt;Zen_Forum@yahoogroups.com&gt;<br />From: "Al" &lt;actionheroes@earthlink.net&gt;<br />Date: Sat, 21 Jan 2006 08:32:16 -0500<br />Subject: [Zen] Unity in spite of differences.<br /><br /><tt>This PETA & Cat Zen discussion has really illustrated something to me. It<br />all started with news about a guy who tried to kill a rat and it burned down<br />his house.<br /><br />It has continued with some interesting information, but also a lot of folks<br />demonstrating deep feelings or hardened attitudes and opinions about cats,<br />dogs, PETA, and various other issues.<br /><br />Some person joined to state that she was going to be banned because of her<br />love for animals, and then she quit (banned herself?). Are so many people<br />nuts?<br /><br />Then this morning I was listening to the radio, and Michael Medved came on<br />to push some book he wrote about how he used to be a volunteer for Bobby<br />Kennedy &amp; George McGovern and then became a "Reagan Republican." Medved then<br />went on to ridicule and lambaste liberals, Democrats, etc.<br /><br />What I realized is that people no longer respect each other. There is no<br />respect for ideas or other people. We should all be able to have a<br />light-hearted discussion about cats, dogs, or politics without hurting each<br />others' sensibilities. But nowadays, there seems to be an nasty attitude<br />that permeates all discussions. That smug anti-intellectual attitude is that<br />there is only one right answer for any question, and that anyone who<br />proposes a different opinion is either stupid, deluded, or anti-American,<br />anti-British, subversive, mentally unbalanced, "has issues" or is somehow<br />incapable of intelligent thought.<br /><br />This smug, snide, and superficial attitude is propagated by Rush Limbaugh,<br />O'Reilly, and every so-called Conservative radio host I have heard.<br />Unfortunately, what passes for Liberal radio is just as bad. I have heard<br />Randi Rhodes and that guy who used to be a comedian on Saturday Night Live,<br />and they exude the kind of obnoxious smugness that makes people want to<br />throw up.<br /><br />Anyhow, I guess I can't change anything about the way civilization is<br />de-evolving. Back in the era of Enlightenment (the 1700s); people published<br />some incredible books and had some incredible debates filled with hope and<br />ideas that were radically different, and debate flourished.<br /><br />People can have totally different opinions and still be friends, meet for<br />lunch, go to the park and have a picnic, or go to the movies together. We<br />should not seek to associate only with clones of each other.<br /><br /><br /></tt><!-- **begin egp html banner** --><br /></blockquote>
