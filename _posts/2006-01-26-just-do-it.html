<div id="RTEContent"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="500" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><div class="headline">Good Morning All,</div><br />This quote from one of my favorite books and Teachers, is very important to keep in mind as we go through our day. I thank Tricycle Magazine for providing this quote for us today.<br /><br />I have been attempting to teach this point throughout my career as a priest and therapist. It all begins with a simple choice: be a buddha. Whoah! Too much? OK, well, then, be good. How's that? Still too much? Well then, be good for ten minutes. Still too much? OK then, try a different tack, don't do bad. Too much? Don't do as much bad. Do as little bad as you possibly can.<br /><br />Here's the thing, when we bring 'doing good' or 'not doing bad' to our consciousness, we are waking up our buddha-nature and giving it permission to exist in our lives. When we think we must "be buddhas" then it is overwhelming and we soon lose hope and go back to our old ways. Recrimination is a poison that erodes our practice.<br /><br />So, strive. Lean toward being a buddha. Turn your boat in that direction and float if you want, paddle, or row hard. Its in the turning of direction and commitment to steer that makes us a bodhisattva.<br /><br />Now, just do it.<br /><br />Be well.<br /><div class="headline"></div><div class="headline"><img src="http://www.tricycle.com/images/logonewsletter.gif" /></div><div class="headline"></div><div class="headline"></div><div class="headline">Tricycle's Daily Dharma: January 26, 2006</div><li><a href="http://www.tricycle.com/issues/1_254/dailydharma/1842-1.html" target="_blank"><span style="color:#003399;">An Ordinary Person</span></a></b><br />A bodhisattva is an ordinary person who takes up a course in his or her life that moves in the direction of Buddha. You're a bodhisattva. I'm a bodhisattva; actually, anyone who directs their attention, their life, to practicing the way of life of a Buddha is a bodhisattva. --Kosho Uchiyama,<i> Opening the Hand of Thought</i><br /></li><br /><br /></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
