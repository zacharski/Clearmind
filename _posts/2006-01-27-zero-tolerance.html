<div id="RTEContent">With palms together,</div>Good Morning All,<br /><br />We have all heard of "zero tolerance" policies. Zero tolerance is a masculine vote getter. It is strong, unbending, decisive. It allows no "wiggle room," no "fuzzy" thinking. It is for communities that "know" what they want, or more precisely, what they don't want. And like art, these communities, "know it when they see it." All of which, of course, abandons thought, dialogue, understanding, and compassion. Zero tolerance disallows forgiveness. It cannot permit gray. It fears examination.<br /><br />I once worked with a sixth grade child in a Middle School. He was suspended for making a gun out of his hand, as in a pantomime, and "shooting" at another child. He violated the school's "zero tolerance" policy against weapons and violence. Another child suspended for teasingly kissing a girl in the cheek. They were in the second grade. A violation of sexual harassment policy.<br /><br />From a policing point of view, zero tolerance is a cop's dream. School administrators, police and sheriff departments, and politicians are off the thoughtfulness hook.<br /><br />From a reality point of view, it is a nightmare, disallowing play and experimentation, disallowing intelligent discussion, a broad horizon of ideas, and an relentless unwillingness to engage differences between cultures.<br /><br />It is not an expression of the Middle Way.<br /><br />Now here is where it gets sticky. We will not "negotiate" with "terrorists." We must get a grasp of the language issues here. On the one hand this zero tolerance policy is understandable. Those who employ violence to get what they want should not get it. On the other hand, we are using the label "terrorist" all too easily as a way of avoiding examining the feelings and motivations behind the "terrorist" behavior. From my point of view, for instance, violence is violence. In each case violence is a terror. It injures, maims and kills. It really does not matter whether that violence is dressed in a "good guy" uniform or a "bad guy" uniform or no uniform at all.<br /><br />Negotiation is what? Talk with a purpose of finding a middle way. A way to resolve differences and discover an equitable solution. When we have a zero tolerance there are no solutions except to silence the other guy. Easy. No thinking, no examination. Just stop the other guy from being a thorn in our side, from putting his finger in our nice little cake we've baked and called civilization. I don't know about you, but when there is tape across my mouth my only wish is to tear it off.<br /><br />So here is where it really gets sticky. What if we are talking about Hamas. What if we are talking about the "side" that blew up the World Trade Towers. Is it one thing to have a zero tolerance against children pointing imaginary guns in school and another to fly airplanes into building? Indeed. Silly question. The thing is, if we refuse to examine the karma in our world, that is, the linkages between cultural and religious perceptions, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors as they conflict with others, we are destined not to find solutions. The stronger the effort to not engage, the stronger the effort to engage. People will be heard. It is our job to listen.<br /><br />Be well.
