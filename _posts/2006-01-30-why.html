<div id="RTEContent">With palms together,</div><br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />To sit each morning and each evening is an excellent way to begin and close your day. Stillness allows us to gather ourselves, calm our minds and bodies, and form the necessary mind to enter the world and leave the world as buddhas.  The act of lighting a candle, lighting incense, bowing, then sitting down on the cushion is a profound act of discipline and dedication. In this small theatre for no one to see, there is just you. Placing attention on our breath, allowing what is present to be present, and accepting the gifts of that moment regardless of their qualities, is of enormous benefit. But even if it wasn't of any benefit at all, we should still sit in stillness.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br /><br />___<br /><br />Announcements:<br /><br />Sorry that I am a little late this morning with my message. I spent some good time late last evening building a table and chairs for the computer and when I woke this morning my mind seemed to stay on the pillow.  Housework and lunch has remidied that and here I am.<br /><br />Yesterday's Zen Center zazen was a wonderful experience.  Edgar and Cynthia visited us from Juarez.  Several of us were able to have lunch together at the International Delights Cafe. We decided to begin a Jukai class each Sunday afternoon after lunch, and at this point there are four registrants. If anyone is interested in attending, please feel free to drop in at the zen Center each Sunday at 1:00 PM.<br /> <br />This coming Saturday is Zazenkai.  If anyone is interested in joining me, we will begin at 10:00 AM and close at 4:00 PM at the Zen Center. Notice is important so that I can arrange for ther lunch.<br /><br />Rev. Dai Shin has returned from her sojourn! We look forward to seeing her on Wednesday evening at Zen Center for zazen.
