It would seem no one in authority can get it right.  Freedom of speech?  A t-shirt gets you arrested or tossed out, depending on the message (opposed to the war = arrested; in favor = tossed out).  But wait!  We're sorry!  We shouldn't have done that, the cops now say, sending letters of apology to the two affected. <br /><br />Strange.  And all in full view of the world.
