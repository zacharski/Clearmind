<div id="RTEContent">With palms together,</div><br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />Last night's televised State of the Uniion by the President of the United States was interesting. Ever since I was a child I have admired the Office of the President, the Senate, the House, and the Judiciary. These are powerful symbols of symetry in government.  A free people electing a group to govern its body, each with its own set of functions, each with built in checks and balances.  It is a marvel.<br /><br />My understanding of the State of the Union address is that it is a sort of report card on the Executive branch's understanding of how things are going in the nation. A report card, to be useful, contains everything,  the positive efforts and attainments, as well as the not so positives, and indeed, the failures.  Mr. Bush did a reasonable job with this last night. <br /><br />My problem is that the event did not seem to match in any way the realities of my experience of America.  The noble efforts of bringing democracy to the world is blackened by the means:war, assaults on freedom, and intimidation. The same is true of our work with AIDS. The goal of reducing and eliminating this deadly disease is righteous, but the US's demand to do so by abstinance only programs is childish.<br /><br />Mr. Bush telling us we are addicted to oil is a little like the tobacco companies blaming the victims of their marketing campagns. The truth is we are addicted to oil and Mr. Bush assisted us in that addiction. <br /><br />That said, I do not deny that there are elements of the agenda I agree with completely, most in fact.  We must improve our schools, reduce oil consumption, engage the world in democracy. I question only the tools. People must choose democracy, see its value from a model worth emulating.  A model that does not torture, a model that values difference, supports minorities, and trusts its people. We must value education, trust our teachers, honor them with highest pay possible, build schools children want to attend, make education a national value, learning a priority, and intellectual activity a sexy thing.  We must value alternative energy development and put our research money where our mouth is.  We must legislate to support alternative energies.  We must make it not only possible, but desirable, to drive vehicles powered by fuels that are both renewable and non-polluting.  <br /><br />Above all, we must value peace and non-violence.  In a country that witnesses more violence on a given day than any country in the world, this will be difficult. We are a reactive, rather than proactive people and this must change. Our country values weapons.  It supports weapons.  It values individual action to defend itself. And understands the first choice when confronted by a threat is force rather than undertstanding and compassion.  It suspects people outside of the group, locks its doors, and spies on its neighbors.  In such a culture, where can peace and trust and love reside? To be a peaceful model to the world we must address, challenge, and change this.<br /><br />So, perhaps such action is a role for Engaged Zen. I admire that single lone mother for being arrested last night. I am ashamed that there weren't a million other mothers and fathers arrested with her.<br /><br />We must raise our voice and engage in the process of change. We have little choice.<br /><br />Be well.
