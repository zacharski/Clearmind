With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />The display of Mohammed in cartoon form would seem to some a frivolous thing. Yet, embassies are burning and millions of people are outraged. Lives are being threatened, products banned, and people are rioting in the streets. The newspapers who printed these cartoons stand behind their freedoms.  The cartoonist is expressing an opinion.  A point was being made.  A limit was being tested. On balance, what can we say?<br /><br />Sensitivity to the beliefs and faith of others is an important tenent of civilized life. While it is wrong for Islam to portray rabbis as cannabals and the clergy there to remain mute, it is equally wrong for us to portray Mohammed in pictoral form and for us to remain mute.  We must learn to respect each other.<br /><br />Freedom of the press is very important, we should strongly defend it.  Yet, just because we <em><strong>can</strong></em> do something, does not mean that we <strong><em>should</em></strong> do it. People hold the symbols of their faith close. As Zen Buddhists we might say too close, as this sort of thing leads to suffering and can become a hindrance to seeing clearly, still people in fact do hold their symbols closely. Does this give us the right to hit them over the head with a hammer to help them see the error of their ways? I don't think so. Wiser means are necessary.  In a culture that values respect, respect is a skillful means.<br /><br />Be well.
