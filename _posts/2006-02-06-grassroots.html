With palms together,<br /><br />Good Afternoon Sangha,<br /><br />We have a local newspaper here in Las Cruces called "The Grassroots Press."  It is a tiny little thing devoted to social action. I noticed that there is a weekly "Peace Vigil" at the Federal Courthouse every Wednesday from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM.  The ad says people should bring sunscreen, water, and signs. I think this is a great idea. Beginning next Wednesday, I think I'll be out there.  This Wednesday coming I'll be in Cleveland for our daughter's doctoral defense.<br /><br />One of the things each of you might do in your area is find a similar "Peace Vigil" or create one of your own. Place a ad in a local paper to spead the word, or better yet, write a short press release indicating your intention, time, and place.  Often local papers are online and you can get the editor's email address to send in a press release.  Newspapers will often print these free.<br /><br />There is only one way we are going to make a difference and that is from the ground up. One bodhisattva at a time.<br /><br />Be well.
