With palms together,<br />Hello Sangha,<br /><br />We are back in New Mexico again.  How wonderful!  The sun is shining and the sky is clear and blue and very beautiful!  I had an opportunity to practice much Zazen on the way back home: long flights, nothing to eat. The airline did not even have tea. I read some of an old friend, The Eight Gates of Zen, but mostly sat Zazen in the air.<br /><br />Tomorrow morning I will be at Zen Center to practice Zazen in the morning.  I will have lunch at the International Delights Cafe and will be happy to meet with anyone interested in Engaged Practice. At 1:00 PM we will re-convene at Zen Center for Precept Study, then at 2:30 we will continue our study of Master Dogen's Bendowa.<br /><br />Be well.
