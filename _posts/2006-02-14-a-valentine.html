With palms together,<br />Good Morning Sangha,<br /><br />May each of your hearts be warm and open.<br /><br />In a world where the news is as an acid to our connections with one another, I ask that we hold hands in prayer. Love is the antidote to hatred. There is no more powerful antidote to its corrosive effects. Yet, to love requires courage and faith.  Courage to love those that hate us; faith that in the process of loving, life will continue to blossom.  If we are worried that our individual flame will be snuffed out, we are lost.<br /><br />We must look deeply at this hate, see its fundamental cause as fear, and assuage that fear.  In its place, we offer peace and compassionate regard. We offer support and nurturance. We do not feed the delusion of separation, we feed the truth of oneness and interdependence. Who here is a separate, fully self-sustaining individual who has "made it" with no help or support or teaching or encouragement or nurturance from others?  <br /><br />It is so easy to talk this talk.  My challenge is for each of us to walk it.<br /><br />Another form of kinhin.<br /><br />Be well.
