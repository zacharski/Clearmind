<div>With palms together,</div>  <div>Good Evening Sangha,</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Please forgive this short post. I am just passing through my home on my way to another meeting.&nbsp; We stood on the corner of the Federal Building in downtown Las Cruces a little while ago.&nbsp; There were several people there with signs.&nbsp; I had made a small sign that simply said "PEACE."&nbsp; There was a good wind blowing, but the sun was out and the sky was blue and people in the passing cars seemed very happy to see us there on the corner. </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>It was good to see some old friends standing there.&nbsp; It was also good to meet new people who share a dream of a peaceful world. Rev. Dai Shin, thank you for attending.&nbsp; Vicki, it was good to see you there as well!</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>However much time you have to offer to this effort, please offer it.&nbsp; War is such a waste, a painful, insidious waste, that accomplishes nothing, polarizes  people, fuels hatred and mistrust, and&nbsp;drains resources while extinguishing lives.Find a vigil in your community, make a small sign, and take a silent stand against&nbsp;war.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Be well.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div><BR><BR>May All Beings Be Free From Suffering<br>So Daiho<br><br>Zazen at Zen Center of Las Cruces: Sundays 10:00 AM; Wednesdays 7:00 PM<br>Zazen at Dharma Mountain Zendo: Sundays 10:00 AM<br>On the web at http://www.daihoji.org/ and http://daihoji.blogspot.com/<p> 		<hr size=1>Brings words and photos together (easily) with<br>  <a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/mail_us/taglines/PMall/*http://photomail.mail.yahoo.com">PhotoMail </a> - it's free and works with Yahoo!
