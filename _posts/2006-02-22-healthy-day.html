With palms together,<br />Good Morning Sangha,<br /><br />This morning is a beautiful morning here in southern New Mexico. The sky is blue with just a hint of a cloud or two, the air is cool and the sun is getting ready to make its short winter journey across the sky. I have had some coffee. My Little Honey made the coffee and took out the dogs. So, I am left to compose this short message.<br /><br />Today I would invite you to take one small step to improve your health. Eat a little less, choose a piece of fruit instead of a cookie. Park far away from the store entrance and walk to the store. Take a multavitimin. Drink a small glass of V-8 juice. Snack on almonds or walnuts, a small handfullk will do. Choose not to eat meat today. Talk to a friend about something personal. Sit Zazen. If you add or two of these daily you will begin to follow a program shown to prevent or reverse heart disease.<br /><br />Now I must *run* to meet the Rabbi for breakfast at the Bountiful.<br /><br />Be well.<br /><br />On this day in history: 1940 - Five-year-old <a href="javascript:ol(">Tenzin Gyatso</a> was enthroned as the 14th <a href="javascript:ol(">Dalai Lama</a> in <a href="javascript:ol(">Lhasa</a>, <a href="javascript:ol(">Tibet</a>.
