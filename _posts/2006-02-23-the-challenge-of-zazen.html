With palms together,<br />Good Morning Sangha,<br /><br />This morning I lit sticks of incense and said a prayer for all of those in the world who were suffering.  It seems from the morning's news, there's a lot of that going around. Mudslides, wars, violence against individuals, communities, and religious buildings. I take a breath and sit down on my cushion, turn and face the wall. My hands rest gently in the cosmic mudra, left hand cradled in the right, thumbs lightly touching.  I feel the presense of the universe wrap me like a blanket, creating a nest of safety and security. This, however, is not Zazen.  It is just a good feeling.<br /><br />It takes work to move against this, to press out the warmth, to lift off the blanket and open myself to the larger processes of life and death. To be one with the universe means some very challenging things.  It means we do not hide from the suffering of others. It means we do not have the luxury of being overwhelmed by the global nature of the task or its seeming futility.  It means we have an obligation to behave just now, right here, in this moment and perhaps exceeding our capacity. It means we must open our eyes and experience the universe as it is, rather than as some sugar coated pill we would like it to be. I have heard it said that science discovers and describes what is, and religion discovers and describes what ought to be.  Where is the bridge?<br /><br />Look in the mirror.<br /><br />Be well.
