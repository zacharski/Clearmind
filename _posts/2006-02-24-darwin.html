With palms together,<br />Good Morning Sangha,<br /><br />The trouble with violence is that it is too often used instead of compasssion, understanding, and a willingness to work out a solution to a problem. It becomes easy.  It becomes a habit.  It becomes automatic. When this happens, and we develop a rationale that enables the habit, then we lose civilization. We become addicts who can't stand to hear the word, "no."<br /><br />Violence disallows a long view, it demands a short view.  Violence does not consider others, it only considers ourselves.  Violence is me first, you last. Violence is a statement of egoistic priority.<br /><br />Non-violence demands a long view, it requires patience, a willingness to accept difference, and a willingness to think. Non-violence puts others first and ourselves last. Non-violence is a statement of mutual aid as priority.  Non-violence is civilization.<br /><br />For decades the social Darwinists have suggested dominance through violence, fierce competition, and placing winning between the eyes, is a natural condition. Yet these social scientists often fail to see the most basic elements of survival.<br /><br />The fittest survives.  The question is, what deternmines "fitness"?  Is it strength?  Is it the willingness to use force?   I doubt it.  These are short term and short sighted quick fixes to meet our impatient needs. I suggest fitness is manifest in compassion. In our willingness to understanding others. And in our willingness to provide mutual aid. In this sense, the fittest are those who are the most caring and compassionate among us.  The fittest are those willing to set aside heir own needs for the sake and well-being of all. <br /><br />We survive because we care for each other.  We survive because we are interconnected with each other.  We thrive when we celebrate that care and that interconnection.<br /><br />Lets each of us find a way today to be of benefit to others.<br /><br />Be well.
