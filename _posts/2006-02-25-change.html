With palms together,<br />Good Morning Sangha,<br /><br />If you are at work reading this, or at school, please consider that this moment is not a dress rehearsal for some future moment of life.  This is your life. If there is something you do not like about this moment, as Thoreau once said, change it.<br /><br />If our immediate thought is, "I can't", then you can't. You, yourself, are a hindrance to your change. If you say, "OK, tomorrow, I will begin."  Then you are living in a delusion. This moment is it. Only this moment.<br /><br />Now is the time. Now.<br /><br />Be well.
