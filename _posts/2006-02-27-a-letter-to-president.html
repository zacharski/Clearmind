Dear Mr. President:<br /><br />In the news this evening I read a story about the proposed budget cuts to the Department of Veterans Affairs.  I know it is important to cut the tremendous deficit your administration has run up, but do you have to cut it at veteran's expense? <br /><br />I have an idea, if you want to cut the deficit, how about eliminating our nuclear weapons, stop sending people to war in the first place, and reduce the military's size and role in the world?  This war you started is costing us far too much money and lives, say nothing of our esteem and credibility in the world.  I grew up in a country I thought was peace loving.  I never thought we would ever start a war. And now that we have a war you started, and you are sending hundreds of thousands of people into harm's way, you have decided to cut the benefits of those who are serving you?  This is shameful.<br /><br />I urge you to reconsider your position on this war, end it as soon as possible, eliminate nuclear weapons, reduce military spending, and make sure our soldiers get the best possible care for their service to our country.<br /><br />Be well.
