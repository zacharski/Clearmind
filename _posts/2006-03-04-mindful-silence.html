With palms together,<br />Good Morning Sangha,<br /><br />My suggestion for today is to spend the day in mindful silence. It is a good practice.<br /><br />Speak only when spoken to in as limited and gentle way as possible. When we do this we are placing ourselves in the position of being open to our lives in a way that doesn't happen when we are busy with our minds and mouths.<br /><br />Knowing that we are not speaking, we can listen more closely. Listening more closely enables a more intimate connection to be made to our world. It is in this intimacy that profound change occurs.<br /><br />___<br /><br />Due to lack of participants, today's Zazenkai at Zen Center is cancelled. Please remember we have our Hannamatsuri sesshin scheduled for the first Friday weekend of April.<br /><br />Be well.
