With palms together,<br />Good Evening Sangha,<br /><br />This evening I was thinking about what I could possibly write about. I thought about this:<br /><br />50 Simple things to do:<br /><br />Turn off lights when you are not using them. <br />Use energy saving bulbs.<br />Cook as little as possible, use cold foods in the summer.<br />Buy in quantities, then parcel into smaller portions for storage and later use.<br />Use a half shot glass of bleach in a spray water bottle instead of a cleanser to disinfect counter surfaces.<br />Flush the toilet less times per day.<br />Turn off the tap when not actually using the water.<br />Set your water heater on medium rather than high.<br />Bike rather than drive.<br />Walk rather than bike.<br />Park as far away from the entrance of a store as you possibly can then walk.<br />Eat six times a day, but smaller amounts. <br />Eat fruit.<br />Eat veggies.<br />Drink juice.<br />Drink lots of water.<br />Make as much from scratch as you can.<br />Enjoy yourself.<br />Each day for a week eat something you've not tried before.<br />Eat more nuts.<br />Smile as often as possible, especially when you don't feel like it.<br />Tell your partner you love them.<br />Show your partner your love in non-verbal ways.<br />Volunteer.<br />Work less than you think you should.<br />Turn off your cell phone for a day.<br />Begin a diary.<br />Stop writing in your diary.<br />Shift gears often.<br />When biking, wear a helmet.<br />Be kind to animals.<br />Adopt a pet.<br />Be kind to children.<br />Adopt a child.<br />Support charities as you can.<br />Visit a new place once a week.<br />Lay down on the floor at least once a day.<br />Use more bicarbonate of soda.<br />Use more vinegar.<br />Reject most TV.<br />Reject most movies.<br />Read a book.<br />Then read another book.<br />Then tell someone about the first book.<br />Join a club.<br />Vote.<br />Make love as much as possible.<br />Hug your kids.<br />Listen to as many people as possible.<br />Look people in the eyes<br /><br />Above all,<br />Be well..
