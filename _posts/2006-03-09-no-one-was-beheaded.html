With palms together,<br />Good Morning Sangha,<br /><br />Yesterday's Peace Vigil was a great success if one measures success by the vibrancy of a group. We stood against the wind, a cold wind blowing across the desert valley. There were a couple of dozen women and a few men standing there along the avenue lacing the Federal Building. Public television was there.  A few print media were there. Cameras were happy.<br /><br />Passersby honked their horns in support.  A few lifted a finger expressing their disapproval. This is America. No one was shot.  No one beheaded.<br /><br />That morning I met with local people interested in Jewish Law.  The topic was "Should clergy marry people in a religious wedding without a license?"  This is an effort to have a marrage sanctioned by God, but avoiding the problems with Social Security pension laws, although a few dissented, the answer was a clear no.  We should not engage in deceitful behavior. During this discussion, a Christian minister made a few comments about homosexual unions, a heated debate ensued. Again, no one came to blows.  No one was beheaded.<br /><br />I noticed the authorities arrested three college students in the arson attacks of several churches in the deep south. No riots. No killings. No beheadings.<br /><br />Last night at Zen Center, we sat Zazen in perfect stillness.<br /><br />It is possible to have passionate views far apart from our neighbors and not bring harm to them.  That is a very hopeful message. While we in the United States are far from perfect and we do in fact harm others in our behavior, we still have something we can offer the world. This should be our message..<br /><br />Be well.
