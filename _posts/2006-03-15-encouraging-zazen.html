With palms together,<br />Good Morning Sangha,<br /><br />Zazen can be the foundation of our life. When we make it so, it is the ground we walk on, the support we have through the day, our greatest teacher, our stalwart companion. . What is it about this practice that makes it so?<br /><br />Deciding to take a seat, gather oneself together, enfold one's hands to complete a circle, and place our attention on witnessing only, enables us.<br /><br />It enables us to settle down.  It enables us to pay attention to the inner workings of our lives.  It enables us to see the interaction between the inner and outer workings of the universe. All without having to do anything about anything.<br /><br />Over time a certain deep and abiding trust develops from this practice.  A trust in the universal processes of living and dying. We learn that we can let go and everything will still exist.  Me and you cease to have real meaning. We see that we create meaning, and in so doing we create our suffering.<br /><br />All of these rise and fall in our awareness, and still we don't engage them.  Our job is to simply witness.<br /><br />I encourage each of you to take up this practice. Make this practice a model for living.<br />Any moment will do.  Just pay attention. At some point, decide to sit more formally.  Find a time, find a place.  Sit down and practice Zazen.In that moment, know that peace is not only possible, but a reality.<br /><br />Be well.
