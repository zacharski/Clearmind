With palms Together,<br />Good Morning Sangha,<br /><br />This weekend will mark the third anniversary of the beginning of the Iraq war. We will mark this with peace vigils throught the US. In our area, there are vigils planned in different locations:<br /><br />In Las Cruces: 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM in the parking lot across from the Federal Courthouse.<br /><br />In El Paso: 1:00 PM to 2:30 PM, at the San Jacinto Plaza, Mesa/Oregon and Main/Mills Sts.,Downtown El Paso. Contact Merlyn or Joe at &lt;<a href="http://us.f605.mail.yahoo.com/ym/Compose?To=jheyman@elp.rr.com&amp;YY=98670&order=down&amp;sort=date&pos=0&amp;amp;view=a&head=b"><span style="color:#003399;">jheyman@elp.rr.com</span></a>&gt; for more information.<br /><br />Peace does not come without effort. Peace is an active process.  We must deliberately put down arms, we must deliberately attempt to find other ways to solve conflicts, address grievences, and correct wrongs. Adding violence just adds violence.  It resolves nothing.  Our government will continue to misbehave until we make it unacceptable by moral authority, electoral process, public opinion, and the weight of our votes.<br /><br />I am not naive.  I do not believe standing around on a corner will stop a war. But what I do believe is that standing around on a corner with simple signs of consciience will begin to create conditions for alternative views in people. We must stand as witnesses. The majority must not be silent.  Every day soldiers and civilians in the war-torn parts of this world are suffering and dying without a voice saying enough. We can stand for an hour as a voice to help in some small way bring them home. And if we don't have the time, there is something clearly wrong with our priorities.<br /><br />Be well.
