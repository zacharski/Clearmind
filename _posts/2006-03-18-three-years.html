With palms together,<br />Good Morning Sangha,<br /><br /><br />Please take a few minutes today and consider peace. This is the third anniversary of our invasion of Iraq. Peace happens when we become peace. To become peace means to become complete within ourselves and others. Our practice, Zazen, Kinhin, Samu, Oryoki: all are peacemaking practices. They are practices that teach us serenity in a flood of world activity.<br /><br />When we sit, we sit.  When we walk, we walk.  When we work, we work.  When we eat, we eat. Nothing special.  Nothing added. We are serene reflection in motion.<br /><br />To be at war is to be at conflict and to be angry, greedy, and deluded.  Who wishes to walk that path?<br /><br />Today, please take a small sign that simply reads "Peace."  Go outside and stand.<br /><br />Be well.
