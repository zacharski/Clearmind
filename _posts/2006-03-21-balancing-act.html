With palms together,<br />Good Morning Sangha,<br /><br />With so much going on outside in the world, it is easy to go there and get lost or caught up in the whirlwind.  Our perception is that it is outside of us and is so important that we must do something. War, poverty, injustice, disease; these are awful things worthy of our attention and our energy.<br /><br />Yet, in truth, these things are not out there, but inside of us.  In our minds and our hearts. We respond with a disturbed body, we become ill. In such a condition we are not present for our friends and family.  We are not fully there for our co-workers and employers.<br /><br />These things are important.  We should do what we can to ease suffering, stop violence, bring health to the ill. We should do so, however, with a healthy mind, a healthy body, and a wholesome heart. This requires us to establish boundaries, maintain these boundaries, and nurture those boundaries.<br /><br />A boundary is a point where doing begins to hurt us.<br /><br />Recognizing that there are limits to our power and capacity to be of service, to absorb suffering, and to be present, is a necessary first step. Willingness to say no is the second step. Finally we must nurture ourselves as a third step.  Eating well, getting enough sleep, getting exercise, practicing Zazen, openning our hearts to others in discussion: these are ways of taking good care of ourselves.<br /><br />In the absolute sense we are one with the universe.  In the relative sense we are just a finite body with finite energy. Our practice is to live between the two recognizing the truth and needs of both.<br /><br />Be well.
