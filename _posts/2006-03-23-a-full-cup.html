With palms together,<br />Good Morning Sangha,<br /><br />There is a story about a scholar who visits an Old Zen Master to receive instruction.  The Master pours tea into a cup for the scholar; full, the cup overflows until the scholar shouts "stop!"<br /><br />Unless we are willing to empty ourselves of what we think we know, there can be no room for what presents itself in each moment. Zazen is like a slow leak.<br /><br />Take your cup and go.<br /><br />Be well.
