With palms together,<br />Good Morning Sangha,<br /><br />In the morning we will be leaving for Memphis to  visit our daughter, not-son-in-law, and grandbaby Tate. We are looking forward to the drive and the visit. I will post from Memphis when I get there.<br /><br />Driving long distance is sort of like running long distance: an integration of things occurs as we settle into the drive. At first its all a flutter, did we pack this, forget that? But as the drive continues, just as with running, and sitting Zazen, a natural rhythm develops or settles in. This is our natural state when mind is not overly intruding. It is good practice.<br /><br />Finding a way to make this naturalness a part of everything you do is the Third Pure Precept in action.<br /><br />Be well.
