This morning we awake to the cries of Baby Tate and a telephone call from New Mexico.  Tate is grumpy, but always willing to giggle for a moment when Pappy Zen makes odd faces.  Susanne, our neighbor at the Refuge, called to say that my old friend, Shaker, was collicking last night. A veterinarian visit later suggested she was OK.  This morning Susanne says she is lethargic.<br /><br />To be alive means to feel. Sometimes we feel good, sometimes not.  Sometimes we are happy, sometimes not. To be awake means that when we are hot, we are fully hot; when we are cold, we are fully cold.  Enlightenment does nothing to make what is there better. It is what we call being one with the universe and the universe is a vast container. Being one with being sick means fully being sick, present with our sickness, completely.  A thought of escaping our sickness leads us to suffering as it adds duality to our consciousness, separating us from ourselves, adding a discernment.<br /><br />When someone we care for is suffering, we suffer. When we are hot, we are hot. When we are cold, we are cold. As we are these things, we naturally do what we can within them.  We care for our suffering. We add a blanket, take off a blanket, but we do so without the effort of mental anguish.<br /><br />The ability to do this comes with the wisdom of mindful presence.<br /><br />Be well.
