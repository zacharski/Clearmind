With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />Today is a day you can use to change the world. Rita, a member of my Zen Living Yahoogroups list, my Yahoo 360 friend, and Child Protective Services Worker in California, invited everyone to do something today to Change the World.<br /><br />I am passing this invitation along.<br /><br />Each one of us, doing something good, can and will make a difference.  Small as a smile and invitation to talk, large as picking up trash along a pathway, each act of kindness to self and others creates goodness in the world.<br /><br />Now, go change the world.<br /><br />Be well.<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/mail_us/taglines/postman8/*http://us.rd.yahoo.com/evt=39663/*http://voice.yahoo.com"><br /></a>
