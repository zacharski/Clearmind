With palms together,<br />Good Morning Sangha,<br /><br />This morning is overcast and drizzling.  The rain is wonderful.  The air is cool and heavy, unlike the desert. Green is unfolding all around.  I saw beautiful flowers in bloom this morning. Lots of early birds getting their worms, as well. Life is a good thing when kept in perspective.<br /><br />I urge each of us to get outside today.  Enjoy the weather, whatever it is. It is always a good idea to go outside.  It gives us perspective.  Sitting on grass. A park bench. Or just walking along and listening, smelling, feeling, that life around us. After a short time, whatever heaviness that we might be bearing, lifts.<br /><br />We breathe in, knowing we are breathing in, we breathe out, knowing we are breathing out.  Short step, long step, jog, walk, run, skip: no matter, we are Zen in motion.<br /><br /> Be well.<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/mail_us/taglines/postman7/*http://us.rd.yahoo.com/evt=39666/*http://beta.messenger.yahoo.com"><br /></a>
