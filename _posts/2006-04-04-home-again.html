With palms together,<br />Good Evening Sangha,<br /><br />We arrived home a hour or so ago. It is very nice to be back in the desert southwest.  We enjoyed our trip 'back east' but I confess, its not my favorite region. Way too many people, and even in the south, moving way too fast for me. I was good to hold and care for our grandson, though.  We took care of him pretty much night and day for five days.<br /><br />One of the things I do admire about the south, however, is the way people instill basic social manners in children.  I held a door open for a young mother and children, for example, and mother was quickly to ask the child to say "thank you" by saying out loud behind her, "We say 'thank you,' darlin.'"  People often addressed me with a respectful, "sir."<br /><br />We have such manners among ranch folk out here, as well.  But I'm afraid it seems to be a disappearing value. So accustomed we are to being addressed by our first name by total strangers. Many seem to feel comfortable using l obscenities at their leisure in public places <br /><br />People feel no discomfort in calling homes late at night, intruding in private life with work whenever, and being rude and crude on the Internet.  Anonymity loosens the tongue and the boundaries of civil discourse.  Just as familiarity breeds the potential for contempt.<br /><br />My life in the mountains over the last few years spoiled me to some degree, I suppose, or sheltered me some. I don't know. While there is a profound sense of general willingness to love among people, there is also a equally quick willingness to show a lack of patience and temper.<br /><br />We need to work on this.  All of us.<br /><br />Be well.
