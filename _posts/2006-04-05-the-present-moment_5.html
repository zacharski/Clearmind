With palms together,<br />Good Morning Sangha,<br /><br />There was once a monk named Tanzan.  Tanzan was an older monk and did not pay close attention to the rules.  He ate when he was hungry, slept when he was sleepy.  He drank wine on occasion even though intoxicants were forbidden.<br /><br />One day Tanzan and another monk were walking along and they arrived at a stream.  There was a young woman at the stream trying to cross without muddying herself.  Tanzan simply picked her up and carried her across the stream, placing her back on the ground, he put his palms together, bowed and continued on his way.  Sometime later, Tanzan's companion criticized Tanzan for having touched the young woman by carrying her across the stream. Tanzan simply said to his younger brother, "I put her down miles ago, why is it you still carry her with you?"<br /><br />Each of us has an opportunity each moment to renew ourselves. Carrying the burdens of the past prevents this.  In each moment, be a buddha. When you are angry, be angry and let it go.  When you are sad, be sad and let it go.  When you are happy, be happy and let it go. To experience life fully and completely is being a buddha. To live in the past or in worrry or anticipation of the future is to be asleep.<br /><br />Be well.
