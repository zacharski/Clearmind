With palms together,<br />Good Morning Sangha,<br /><br />Is there time in your day for yourself? A moment where you can stop and be still, opening yourself to everything by not doing?<br /><br />If we do not create such time and opportunity, we waste away. Living well requires both motion and stillness, doing and non-doing. If we tend to a plant too much it will die.  If we tend to it too little, it will also die. We are the same.<br /><br />How much of each is sufficient?  In human terms, what is tending and non-tending?<br /><br />Very excellent questions. Questions these are for your practice of living your life.<br /><br />The most important thing is to both answer them, then practice!<br /><br />Life is short, you have a precious opportunity, get going!<br /><br />Be well.
