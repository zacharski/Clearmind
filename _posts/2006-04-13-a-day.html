<div>With palms together,</div>  <div>Good Afternoon Sangha,</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>This morning I went out the door early. A full sun, a cool breeze, and an appointment at the dermatologist's office.&nbsp; The doc and I are&nbsp;buds, we went to the same graduate school. Anyway, I ran down to his office and entered.&nbsp; It was a three mile run and by the time I got there, it was a tad warm.&nbsp; I arrived 15 minutes early, as I had planned so that I could have a little time to cool off and wash up in the restroom. As I began washing off with cold water, the nurse told me he was ready to see me, so sweat and all, I walked into the exam room.&nbsp; </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>He enters right away, we chat for a minute comparing babies (his) grandbabies (mine).&nbsp; He asks why I'm so sweaty.&nbsp; I tell him I jogged to his office.&nbsp; He said I was crazy.&nbsp; I agreed. He did, however, support my craziness. </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>He numbs the skin&nbsp;on  my&nbsp;neck,&nbsp;cuts a chunk out and&nbsp;gave me a couple of scripts. I go back in two weeks. </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Well.&nbsp;&nbsp;Added up, I was in and out in 15 minutes. &nbsp;Way early. My Little Honey was supposed to pick me up at the docs an hour later.&nbsp; So. I ran more.&nbsp; I asked the clerical staff to let Judy know I was at the Barnes &amp; Nobles bookstore and off I went.&nbsp; Another mile. </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>At B &amp; N I browsed through the&nbsp;poetry, religion, philosophy, and running sections for anything new or that piqued my interest.&nbsp; I asked about a new book out by the guy who saved all those souls in Ruwanda.&nbsp; Not in.&nbsp;I heard him on CNN or NPR or somewhere. </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Little Honey arrives and we have lunch at the Bountiful Bakery. After a vegan sandwich, we&nbsp;then went to get the taxes done.&nbsp; Glad that is out of the way. </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>We are now at home, the  temperature on my car thermometer said it was 95 degrees. </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Life comes and goes like that.&nbsp; Both Pepper and Tripper were happy to see us, but quickly went back to sleep on their respective spots on the floor. </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Tonight we will go to the local Temple's Seder, drink a few glasses of wine, eat&nbsp;some matza, and enjoy. </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>For those Jewish Buddhists among us, Happy Pesach!&nbsp; For those Christian Buddhists, Happy Easter!</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Total miles run: 4.0&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Be well.</div><BR><BR><div>Harvey So Daiho Hilbert </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div><IMG src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/40.gif"><BR>May All Beings Be Free From Suffering <BR>On the web at http://www.daihoji.org/ <BR>and http://daihoji.blogspot.com/</div><p> 		<hr size=1>New Yahoo!
