With palms together,<br />Good Morning Sangha,<br /><br />We have been exploring reality from the point of view that both objective and subjective experience are one. One makes the other, the other makes the one.  In fact, they are the same reality experienced in different ways, from different perspectives: very functional. We must be able to see subject and object at certain times, use thought to plan, etc.  But we must also not lose sight of the fact that this is an artificial device created through the way our brain works in order to enhance our survival.  Reality itself, is not two, but one.<br /><br />When we approach our life, our practice, in this way, we begin to see that everything is sacred, nothing is profane.  Indeed, such categories are local devices, rather than universal truth. As we light a stick of incense, all beings are lighting a stick of incense.  As we bow, all beings are bowing.  As we bring ourselves to the other shore, all beings are brought to the other shore. You and God share the same space, the same reality. When you touch, God touches.  When you see, God sees.  When you eat, God eats. Being one with God changes everything.<br /><br />This is nothing more than the simple truth.<br /><br />So difficult, however, to realize, so powerful the discriminating brain.<br /><br />Whether we each believe in God is irrelevant. Call God the universe, it doesn't really matter. What matters is your willingness to open yourself to its vastness.<br /><br />Be well.
