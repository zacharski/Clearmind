With palms together,<br />Good Evening Sangha,<br /><br />Rev. Gozen, my disciple and abbot of the Zen Center of Las Cruces, gave a wonderful talk this evening.  He spoke of the moment before the word. We are so caught in words and ideas that we fail to really see. When we see with words and ideas, we aren't seeing reality.  I sat in silence there with him in the Zendo feeling a number of things.  I was listening intently and the Dharma was alive and present in the room with us. The tea was excellent. Ryan did a good job as both Ino and server of the tea. I made some mental notes to assist him in the future.<br /><br />A small Zen Center is an intimate place.  We sit in rows facing the great white wall, the scent of sandalwood incense slips to and fro, and the soft flicker of the candle is just enough light to feel warmed by its presence. Our bell is large and sits on a wonderful cushion.  I remember finding it in a shop in San Francisco one day while attending a retreat with the Dalai Lama. On that journey I also found our Buddha statue and incense holder.<br /><br />It is quite a task to establish a new Zen Center. Many small details. But the hearts beat and the many hands come together; soon we are there, sitting silently in rows supporting each other as we practice our Way.<br /><br />So, this morning began with a lot of energy.  My wife was to read her poetry at a local writer's group.  I went with her.  Her work, whimsical word portraits of our grandchildren, was warmly received.  Lunch with friends at a restaurant where I happened to met a couple I married some time ago.  Things between them are going well.  I am happy for them.  I drove Judy home, then went grocery shopping. After putting away the groceries, I rode my bike to the weekly peace vigil where I  pulled my sign out of my backpack and stood for an hour in the afternoon sun. There were so many horns honking in support!  Then the long ride home.  A nice salad for dinner and a shower.  Time to go to the Zen Center for Zazen.<br /><br />Tonight I am here with you. Writing and offering some small voice. Tomorrow morning a walk in the desert, a meeting with the rabbi, a speedwork session and a weight workout. Life is good.<br /><br />Be well.
