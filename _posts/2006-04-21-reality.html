With palms together,<br />Good Morning Sangha,<br /><br />From Cheng Li's Tales of Kwan Yin<br />Adapted by a friend from a translation by John Blofield<br /><br /><br /><div align="center"><u>Transcendence</u> </div><div>Now I have done with Su-tras </div><div>and pious practices.</div><div>Day and night I recite the Bo-dhi-sat-tvas sacred name, </div><div>rejoicing in the beauty of its sound.</div><div>NOT for me its recitation in multiples of One-hundred and Eight, </div><div>as though it were a duty.</div><div>Does the runner count his breaths, the poet his words, </div><div>or the stream its ripples?</div><div>You sentient beings who seek deliverance, </div><div>why do you NOT <u>let go</u>?</div><div>When sad, </div><div><u>Let go</u> of the cause of sadness.</div><div>When wrathful, </div><div><u>Let go</u> of the occasion of wrath.</div><div>When covetous or lustful, </div><div><u>Let go</u> of the object of desire.</div><div>From moment to moment, </div><div>be free from grasping </div><div>at the illusion of a permanent </div><div>or separate self.</div><div><br /> </div><div>Where there is </div><div>NO separate self to grasp, </div><div>there can be NO permanent sorrow, </div><div>NO graspable desire; </div><div>NO causally-separate me to weep, </div><div>NO compositionally-separate me to lust, </div><div>NO circumstantially-separate being to die </div><div>and NO perceptually-separate being to be reborn.</div><div>The winds of circumstance </div><div>blow across the infinite expanse </div><div>of NON-graspable emptiness.</div><div>Whom can they harm?</div><div> </div><div>____________________________</div><div> </div><div>This is the essence of the source of compassion. In the Heart Sutra we chant "No hindrance in the mind, therefore no fear."  Once we are able to see through to the other side, be the other side, having never left; that is, realize this side and that side (birh and death, heaven and hell, samsara and nirvana, God and Me) are the same, two sides of the same coin, then there is no hindrance, nothing to fear, no self to be harmed.  Nothing left but the vast processes of the universe and our vast compassion within them. </div><div> </div><div>We establish our reality through our perceptions and these perceptions flow through our senses. While "objective reality" exists without our presence, it depends upon our perceptions of it for its definition in human terms. So, no human contact, no defintion.  Some may say, themn, no existence.  In this we must ask what is existence?  Whast does it mean to be real?  Does the tree falling in the forest make a sound?  What is tree?  Forest? Falling" Sound?  Are these all not human concepts?  No human, no human conceptualization, then?</div><div> </div><div>Zazen.</div><div> </div><div>Be well.</div><div> </div>
