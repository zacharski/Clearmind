With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />As we each sit down on our cushions this morning, each of us drops away, the universe seems to enter, and all drops join the sea. The sea is constant, the drops are momentary. The sea is momentary, the drops are constant.<br /><br />What this means is simple. Everything is both one and many, this one and many is nothing other than words in the theatre of our mind however.<br /><br />No one, not even the most solitary mountain hermit priest can be separate from anything. No one, not even in the most dense crowd is with others.<br /><br />We are in each moment and are not in any other.<br /><br />What does all this cryptic crap mean?<br /><br />Sit Zazen and discover the truth for yourself.<br /><br />Be well. <a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/mail_us/taglines/postman7/*http://us.rd.yahoo.com/evt=39666/*http://messenger.yahoo.com"></a>
