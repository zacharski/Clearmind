With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />How many of us can make a mistake without fear? Do we feel comfortable out of our comfort zone? Can we hear criticism and allow it to just lay there?<br /><br />Most of us, perhaps all of us, cannot. We each have a strong need to be valued, appreciated, esteemed. Interaction with others (and sometimes even ourselves) makes this a challenge. Our culture is habituated toward critique.<br /><br />Valuation is our livelihood. Discrimination our currency.<br /><br />A statement suggesting what we say is off base or inaccurate invite rebuttal. If the rebuttal comes from fear, big problem. Fer creates defensive posturing. Fear closes us off from even looking at the merits of the suggestion: so strong is our need not to be wrong.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />I am wrong often. I speak before I have the facts.  I believe I know what someone is thinking or saying as they are speaking and formulate replies before they have finished their thought.  I guess  I think I'm a mind-reader or something.  My father always charged me with being stupid and incompetent.  I filter through his judgment. And just as surely as he is dead, so am I if I continue in this way.<br /><br />Our practice is to be in this moment.  Being in this moment requires courage as it demands we are open. Being open is a challenge when we are afraid. Yet our practice teaches us there is nothing to fear.  There is no self to be abused, no feeling that will last forever (unless we keep it tightly stored and ready to use, and even then, it will die with us sometime).<br /><br />It is a good practice to just be present without acting. In this practice allow yourself the luxury of not responding.  Make a concerted effort to free your thoughts and let them float away. Those around you might be mystified, this behavior will be a small challenge for them, but I believe at some point this practice will bear fruit.<br /><br />Be well.
