With palms together,<br />Good Afternoon All,<br /><br />Some of you have asked me to elaborate on the teaching of stillness. Let's try this: Create stillness right now. You are obviously at your computer just now.<br /><br />Notice your breath. Where does it come from?  Where does it go?  Feel it as it enters and leaves your body.<br /><br />Notice your eyes. Watch them as they move across the monitor.<br /><br />Notice your mind.  What it is up to?  Questioning?  Yawning?<br /><br />Notice sound. Can you hear your computer?  The sound of the refrigerator or air conditioner? Do you hear yourself swallow?<br /><br />Notice what your mouth feels like inside. Is it moist?  Dry? Where is your tongue? How do your teeth feel?<br /><br />Notice your eyes blinking. Just witness them open and close.<br /><br />Do nothing with anything you notice.  Just let whatever is there be there and feel the stillness in your body. You do not have to immediately hit the delete key or the reply key or any other key.<br /><br />When you are in the presence of others, you can do this as well. There is no law that says you must reply immediately.  Take a few moments and witness yourself.<br /><br />The most important aspect of this practice is attentive non-engagement.<br /><br />When we practice this way, we should notice the need we seem to have to "do" something.  Be careful of this need, it will usually lead to no good.<br /><br />Be well.
