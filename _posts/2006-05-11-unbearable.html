With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />The sun has once again risen and warmed the desert air. The coolness of the night evaporates quickly and we are left with hot, dry air. Where can we go to escape the heat?<br /><br />What is the nature of unbearability? When we suffer and say "this is unbearable!" what do we mean? Our mind is intruding, demanding an alternative to the feelings experienced by our bodies or hearts. In some ways this is a good thing.  Pain is an flag that causes us to look and act to be safe or well.<br /><br />Yet all of these are mental formations, constructs that have no independent existence. They come and go like the breeze or the sun. We suffer in direct proportion to our desire not to suffer. The more we imagine non-suffering and compare that imagined state to that which we abide, we suffer.<br /><br />When it is hot we wish to be cool.  When we are cold, we wish to be warm. All of this wishing separates us from our present moment experience.  It creates a gulf between us and reality.<br /><br />Our practice is to not rant against the heat, but simply be. We can move to the shade, without thinking about escaping the heat.  We can enjoy the heat.  We can recognize that heat and cold are relative states to us, the subject.  We can join the heat and in so doing allow it to lose its power.<br /><br />And so it is with life.<br /><br />Be well.
