With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />The morning news is bothersome, as always. People killed. Expolsions.  Domestic spying.  Lawsuits. Sometimes it is good practice to avoid the newspaper and internet news services. The type and level of information, speed of delivery, and tone is poisonous to the spirit.<br /><br />Yet, we don't really want to live as ostriches.<br /><br />It is important to know your world and the happenings within it.  It is important to know what your government is doing, how it is doing it, and the goals it claims in the process. Our government does not seem to be as forthcoming as it might be.  We are fighting a war, it claims.<br /><br />Remember the works of fiction that warned us in school?  1984, Brave New World, Player Piano (the first Kurt Vonnegut jr. book which was quite interesting in light of today's world)? <br /><br />Here we are.  Of course its not the same.  The threats are real.  And so are the psychological processes of leading through fear. Like lemmings, we are willingly giving up our rights to privacy.  We are giving up our money and many of our freedoms to wage wars of peace and end fear and intimidation by Third World sets of people wanting to bring back the Middle Ages.<br /><br />I am one who believes terror wins when we decide to become fearful, hiding, and secret. A brave society is a society that remains free and above board even when threatened. A compassionate society cares about our enemies, nurtures the poor and the weak regardless of race, creed, or national origin. A smart society lives beyond superstition and the fear of fundamentalists and their devil. <br /><br />When your heart is closed, you die regardless of whether you are safe.  When your heart is open, you live even if you are in danger.<br /><br />Be well.
