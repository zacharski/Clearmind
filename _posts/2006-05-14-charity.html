With palms together,<br />Good Afternoon All,<br /><br />The first of the Six Paramitas is <em>Dana</em>, or <em>Genersoity</em>.  I enjoy this paramita very much as it reminds me that to be generous means to be so without self. Any reminder to drop away self is a good thing.  We spend so much of our day wrapped up in ourselves, that to get out of the wrapper is actually quite liberating.<br /><br />In the Diamond Sutra, the Buddha taught that a man should "bestow alms, uninfluenced by any pre-conceived thoughts as to self and other selves..." and if in "practicing charity, conceives within his mind...conceptions discriminating himself from other selves, he will be like a man walking in darkness and seeing nothing." (Goddard translation, p.90-91).<br /><br />This has some very specific meaning and teaching. Similar to the Christian notion that if a man asks for a coat, you should also give him your cloak. Thought to self, and judgement as to the worthiness of others has no place in these teachings.<br /><br />The moment self enters, judgement and discernment enters, we are in the darkness and delusion of dualism. The heart of the Buddha's teaching is compassion for others as a starting point and an end in itself. In this sense, then, we enter charity and become charity, within this charity there is no me, no you, no beggar or almsgiver. Being generosity is being Buddha.<br /><br />Another definition of Mutual Aid.<br /><br />Be well.
