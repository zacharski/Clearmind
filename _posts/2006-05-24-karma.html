With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />If you, me, and the universe are one then what is the real teaching of karma?<br /><br />To address this question you must really enter it.You, me, and the universe are products of dualistic thought, convenient and necessary for survival, but weights on the rope of liberation. Karma is nothing other than an understanding of the deep and continuous connections of everything.  Often thought of as cause and effect, we understand karma when we mentally step away and see that streams flow in all directions at once.<br /><br />This is because that is.  Very precise. Very exacting. Nothing is individual or seperate or unnecessary. When you are this teaching, karma is just another useless notion, like heaven and hell, nirvana and samsara, you and me, or the many other rafts along the shore.<br /><br />Be well. <br /><br /><a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/mail_us/taglines/postman8/*http://us.rd.yahoo.com/evt=39663/*http://voice.yahoo.com"><br /></a>
