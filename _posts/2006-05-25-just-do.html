With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />So, you are busy. Too busy to take good care of yourselves.  And then you die. Whatever you were busy with no longer matters a whole lot.<br /><br />The most important thing?<br /><br />In the meantime life happens.  Between the tasks, at the stoplight, during a break, sipping a cup of water, just before you speak, these are the moments we are most awake these days. The rest of the time life seems not to be our own.  We place ourselves on autopilot and just get through.<br /><br />This is no way to live.<br /><br />Stop it. Live in every moment, as you do your task, do it completely; as you drive, drive mindfully; as you speak, speak with care. This is not difficult, but it does take practice.  Sometimes you will be there, sometimes not.  Its OK, just do.<br /><br />Be well.
