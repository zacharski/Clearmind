With palms together,<br />Good Morning Sangha,<br /><br />There is a phrase a Korean Zen Master used frequently: Open mouth already a mistake!<br /><br />This is so true. Language and the workings of our minds to produce language and the thought behind it, is essentially dualistic. There is no getting around it. This is why many koans have no literal, verbal answer and why so often the Master asks the student to "show" him rather than "tell" him.<br /><br />Even in literature this is true, oddly enough. We are asked to show something in our stories and poems, rather than tell something. Pictures, painted or spoken, are better than a thousand words spewed out.<br /><br />Moreover, the moment we open our mouths to speak we are out of the moment and into our thoughts about the moment. Yet we struggle so with this, I know I do.<br /><br />I want to tell you!<br /><br />Yet in doing so, I make a big mistake.<br /><br />You must teach yourself!<br /><br />You must experience yourself!<br /><br />There is no telling that is worth anything. From whence does this desire to tell come?<br /><br />Be well.
