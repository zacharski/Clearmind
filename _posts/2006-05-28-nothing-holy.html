With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />Throughout most of the day yesterday I burnt incense.  I sat Zazen off and on throughout the day and late last night.<br /><br />My mother is in the hospital and was told she does not have long to live.<br /><br />What does one do with such news. Her lungs and heart are very weak and not functioning very well. She has decided against heroic measures, claiming she is ready to die. We talked a couple of times at length about everything.  She has made her peace.<br /><br />We are neither born nor do we die. We neither come nor do we go. In truth, there is no "we" in such matters. These are all just constructs of a mind hardwired to see linear events discreetly. Yet, as Master Bodhidharma once answered, "Vast emptiness.  Nothing holy."<br /><br />We should add, nothing profane.<br /><br />Profane and sacred are one, just as life and death are one. In this sense, the ancient Hebrews had it dead-on:<br /><br />Adonai Eloheinu, Adonai Echud! (The Lord our God, the Lord is One).<br /><br />What we do with such news is we live.<br /><br />Be well.<br /><br /><a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/mail_us/taglines/postman8/*http://us.rd.yahoo.com/evt=39663/*http://voice.yahoo.com"><br /></a>
