With palms together,<br />Good Morning Sangha,<br /><br />Do those killed in battle need company? Is it our way to honor soldiers killed in combat to send more in after them? How should we best make homage to those who defend us? Do we need defending?  When?  At what point? <br /><br />As you go through your day today, off from work, perhaps, please pay attention to these questions.  They are central to this day in the United States.<br /><br />Cooking on a grill does nothing for this; drinking beer does nothing for this; waving a flag and watching a parade does nothing for this.<br /><br />We Americans are not very good at reflection, nor are we particularly good thinkers. We are far too emotional for that.  We live with the hash marks of real or imagined injury on our sleeves and use them to justify our knee-jerk responses to complex problems. Sad.<br /><br />We should be ashamed of ourselves.<br /><br />Memorial Day is a day of remembrance.  What we should be focusing on is the complete and total waste of lives war offers us. Rather than rallying around the troops, giving the government carte blanche to spend our future to support corporations making huge profits on the lives of others, I would suggest we consider alternatives.<br /><br />Today I plan to sit Zazen at the veteran's park on Roadrunner.  I will be there at 10:00AM. Please join me if you can.<br /><br />Be well.
