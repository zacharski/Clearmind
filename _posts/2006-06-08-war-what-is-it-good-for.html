<div style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, new york, times, serif"><br />With palms together,<br /><br />I listened to the news last night. Honestly, I wish we would stop this fighting. I do not understand the need to do such harm.<br /><br />People have dehumanized and demonized each other there for so long I fear it will take centuries of work to repair the damage.<br /><br />I am embarrassed for us in the United States. I believe and believed since before he Iraq War began, this was a very bad idea. We had bad information, were impatient, were quick to rattle the sabres and were itching for a fight. Cooler heads needed to prevail, wisdom went out the window, and savagery was sucked into the vacuum. <br /><br />The Iraqi people have suffered. We have suffered. The entire world is suffering. And in this suffering, hate brews, distrust and suspicion have become the foundation of communication.<br /><br />We can put our heads in the sand, pretend its just not hapening, keep ourselves 'above it all' but there it is, in the air, in the food we eat, the prices we pay for that food, and in our language, our children's eyes, and our own hearts. Better we face it squarely, though we as a people are loath to do so, and engage in a process of reconcilliation. We must stop fighting. We must provide aid. We must stand down the arms and regain our moral compass.<br /><br />Not only we, but the entire world would feel better if we did.  It is important that your voice be heard.  Write to your representatives,  to the local newspapers, stand with us at peace vigils, your silence is often mistaken for agreement or apathy.<br /><br />Be well.<br /><br /></div>
