With palms together,<br />Good Morning Sangha,<br /><br />In the morning news I read about a kitty that tree'd a bear, the beheading of three people in Iraq, that Lindsay Lohan doesn't want to be seen as a "party girl", and that three prisoners of America, held without charges or hope of a trial, just hung themselves in prison. The kitty wins.<br /><br />I, on the other hand, will sit Zazen while the sun rises over the mountains.<br /><br />Be well.
