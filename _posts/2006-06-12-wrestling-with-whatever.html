With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />What are we here for? Why do we exist? Is there indeed a purpose to our existence?<br /><br />Thinking like this leads us to the sky.<br /><br />Such questions.<br /><br />Who knows. Who cares!<br /><br />We are here. That's what matters. Or does it?<br /><br />Thinking like this leads us to the earth.<br /><br />What matters even more?<br /><br />What happens when earth and sky come together.<br /><br />Philosophy and religion have always grappled with such things, as has mythology. Sky beings, lofty, wise, untouched and untouchable on one hand; earth beings, crude, dirty, and wet on the other hand.<br /><br />For philosophy, these were points of departure. The original mind conceiving and then laying out conception: maybe Hegelian, maybe Epicurean. Yet, in literature and mythology, including the stories of the bible, Zen, we see these two wrestling.<br /><br />The Epic of Gilgamesh, that five thousand year old Babylonian drama, casts Gilgamesh the light prince engaging Enkidu the earth demon. Jacob wrestles with God. Beowulf wrestles with Grendel, Buddha wrestles with Mara. In all of these, it is the wrestling that matters.<br /><br />Nothing is clear cut. Nothing is one way or the other. The universe is a sloppy, wet, muddy affair. Yet there are rocks to climb on so that we may dry off and rest for a bit. One such rock might be your church or mosque, yet another, your cushion. In any event the real wrestling resides within.<br /><br />Cherish it.<br />Be well.
