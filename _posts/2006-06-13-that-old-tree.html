With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><em><span style="color:#737373;"></span></em><br /><em><span style="color:#737373;">O Shariputra, remember, Dharma is fundamentally emptiness, no birth, no death. Nothing is pure, nothing is defiled. Nothing can increase, nothing can decrease. Hence: in emptiness, no form, no feeling no thought, no impulse, no consciousness; no eye, no ear, no nose, no tongue, no body, no mind; no seeing, no hearing, no smelling, no tasting, no touching, no thinking, no realm of sight, no realm of thought, no ignorance and no end of ignorance, no old age and death and no end to old age and death. No suffering, no craving, no extinction, no path, no wisdom, no attainment. </span></em><br /><em><span style="color:#737373;"></span></em><br />This scriptural teaching from the Great Heart of Wisdom Sutra, suggests all of the things we believe are real are just concepts created in our minds.  They have no meaning apart from that meaning <em>we</em> apply,.  We must be careful, therefore in our application of, and wedding to, this meaning.  We must see it for what it is, a convenience, a shorthand, a tool, but most of all, <em>an invention</em>.<br /><br />When we can move freely from form to no form, realizing birth and death are artificial constructs, living with both purity and impurity as places upon a single plane of existence, then we are truly free.<br />Clinging to any one of these concepts becomes a knife that cleaves the universe in two.<br /><br />If a tree falls in the forest, does it make a sound?<br /><br />Sound is audible, sound is a name for something audible. For audible to be, there must be ears to hear. For name to be, there must be a mind to both name and recognize name. No sense organs, no sense.<br /><br />So, does a tree falling in the forest make a sound?<br /><br />Be well.
