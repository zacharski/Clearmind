With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />Wisdom requires meditative living, meditative living requires diligence, diligence requires patience, patience requires a moral sensibility, a moral sensibility reguires generosity.<br /><br />The paramitas are one.<br /><br />Let's suppose that you were to spend one day a week on each paramita, with one day off for good behavior. That's not so difficult. Get up in the morning, read something relatingto the paramita of the day, sit Zazen with that paramita in mind.  Drive to work with that paramita, enacting it as you can, seeing where it fits or doesn't fit, how it can be applied or not, and so on.<br /><br />If you spent that entire day examining it as it applies to your actual life, then at the end of a year you will have spent 52 days developing each of these excellences in your life. Fifty-two days of generosity, of morality, of patience, of diligence, of meditation, and of wisdom.<br /><br />What a year, what a person.<br /><br />Be well.
