With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />The desert air is cool this morning, a mere 70 degrees. I am sitting here under the ceiling fan enjoying the air flow over my shoulders.  The orchid on my desk is amazing, beautiful yellow backgrounds splashed with magenta. Both dogs are sleeping and Pete-kitty is rolled up in a small ball near My Little Honey's pillow.<br /><br />The most wonderous things are present if we stop to appreciate them. This stopping requires of us a willingness to just be there.  We are not to disturb. We are not to enter. We are present.<br /><br />When we are present, we experience being in the cool, in the air, in the presence of the universe.  Its the difference of being in the flow as opposed to being against the flow.<br /><br />Yet, here's the thing.  When your little honey gets up and asks where's the coffee is, you don't get defensive, you don't get wrinkled, instead, you walk into the kitchen and make the coffee.<br /><br />Seamless.<br /><br />Be well.
