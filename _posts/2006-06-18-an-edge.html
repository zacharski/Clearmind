With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />As we live out our lives, many of us have the propensity to live on the darker edges of things.  As residents of the edge we see the contrasts between light and dark.  We taste delight and revulsion.  We are right there on that edge! <br /><br />Some are energized in a morose sort of way while there.  Others become lethargic and nihilistic: nothing matters.<br /><br />This edge can be a real blessing or a source of true torture.<br /><br />It is a place without a future. It flails the past. It makes the present a dark stew.<br /><br />Those who see clearly the truth of life and death are tempted to accept this edge and make it home. Wrapping themselves in their robes of futility and acceptance they rot like the corpses they are.<br /><br />The others with clouded minds dance like moths on the tip of the flame. Exquisite.<br /><br />Followers of the Great Way, though, step off the edge. They have faith in the universe and know their way is not to sit on the edge, but to walk in the world doing what needs to be done. Hungry person? Feed him. Cold person? Give him a blanket. Glass breaks on the floor? Sweep it up.  Dog wants out?  Take him out.<br /><br />When your moral conscience is in your body, there is no question.<br /><br />Be well.
