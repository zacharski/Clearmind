With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />Enlightenment.  Powerful word. Lots of people searching for it, most with only a vague feeling as to what it is. Which creates a question in my mind.  If we do not have a clear idea as to what this is, why are we searching for it?<br /><br />My sense is that enlightenment means many things to many people. So they search in myriad directions and along many paths. Some see enlightenment as a sort of higher plane of existence.  We might understand it as holding hands with God or deeply abiding with the universe. Some see it as an escape from suffering.  Others see it as bliss. And still others a sense of seeing clearly. Many things.<br /><br />The thing is, the search is the problem.  To search means that we are looking. This activity is steeped in dualism.<br /><br />So, what do we do?<br /><br />Nothing.  We aspire to enlightenment, sit still with that aspiration, and let ourselves be present.There is really nothing to seek that we don't already possess. Perhaps it is this acceptance, on its deepest level that is truly 'enlightenment.'<br /><br />Be well.
