With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />This morning I am sitting here at the computer feeling a little anxious.  It seems our "router" is not working properly and I am connecting off of an unsecured wireless account. I cannot find my own account in my wireless network.  Anyway, the Geek Squad will be here this afternoon and solve the problem.<br /><br />This Internet is so important, yet its like a frail web, easily torn and disrupted. When it is torn and we are disconnected, it feels very isolating. We have come to rely on our communications for both a sense of community and security. Perhaps this is not so good.<br /><br />When we lived at the Refuge in the mountains, I could not receive television, had little connectivity to the Net, and never read the newspaper. We were living in a natural world: trees, birds, bears. The cycle of life was determined by the sun rising and falling and where in the sky it arched. Our conveniences here in the city, take us far away from that cycle. Light is always available, the Internet is a click away, and the world's condition is present for us 24/7.<br /><br />Neither is better or worse.  They are just so very different and require very differernt sensibilities.<br /><br />As we go through our day, it is important to be mindful of how our environment and ourselves interact and interdepend. We create and re-create ourselves through such interactions. So the self that is here this moment in front of the computer is a very different self that is in the car driving and is still different again from that self sitting in front of another at dinner. And they are the same.<br /><br />Be well.
