With  palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />We have all heard the phrase,"there's one born every minute!" This "one" typically refers to a sucker, a hapless, gullible person, who is easily taken advantage of. None of us want to be seen by others as such a one. We are all too smart or too sophisticated, too sharp, or too quick and nimble to be "taken" by the con artists of the world.<br /><br />When we divide our fellow man like this, into the gullible and the nimble & quick, where is charity? Where is compassion? Where is loving-kindness?<br /><br />There is no room for these qualities, as they become marks of the hapless ones.<br /><br />Interesting isn't it, how our intelligent, high tech, and efficient society has recast discrimination? A discriminating mind now is highly valued, protected, and to be therefore cultivated.<br /><br />So, today, the "one" more appropriately should be thought of as a "critic."<br /><br />Yes, there is one born every minute.<br /><br />Be well.
