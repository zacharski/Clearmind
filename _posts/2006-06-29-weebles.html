With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />If we could see around corners, we would never get hit. But we cannot see around corners, so we must be cautious. I wonder.<br /><br />When we are one with the universe, where is a corner?<br /><br />Caution is like a weeble, tilting to and fro, but never actually getting anywhere.<br /><br />A True Master understands there is no birth and death, just this. A True Master is the Buddha inside and out. The Infinite and Finite are one and without a blink of an eye. A True Master is both giver and receiver at once and at the same moment. A True Master is both love and hate, peace and war, all residing in serene reflection.<br /><br />We call this authority, and being one with it, we call manifest Buddha.<br /><br />Be well.
