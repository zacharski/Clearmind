With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />This morning the sky is overcast, a somewhat unusual state here in the desert. Still, we do have our rainy season and the 4th of July weekend is the 'traditional' mark of its beginning. This morning I go to Zen Center. This afternoon I have a lunch discussion group on Zen Stories at the International Delights Deli and Cafe. A cup of Zen Tea, a liitle rice, salad, hummas and pita, and good conversation.<br /><br />Story telling is a great teacher. Stories are not like television or movies where so little is left to the imagination.  Stories require us to truly engage ourselves, use our history, experience, imaginations, and feelings to co-create and explore the story. In the process we tease out the meanings and the lessons and personalize them. Because of this, stories are always different.  Stories include, by definition, both the story-teller's story and the reader. <br /><br />Today we will study story number four in 101 Zen Stories edited by Reps and Senzaki<br /><a href="http://www.101zenstories.com/">http://www.101zenstories.com/</a><br /><br />Be well.
