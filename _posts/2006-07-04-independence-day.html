With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />Hoopla today in the USA. Independence Day should give us pause to be thankful of the things independence from oppression offers us. Yet this independence is conditional, it always is. We are never independent, as if we are stand alone entities, pulling ourselves up by our bootstraps. This most profound and basic statement of American value contains a fatal flaw. Someone must make the boots, the pants, and the shirts we wear. Someone must drill for the oil we burn, grow and harvest the food we eat, make the chemicals and do the magic that creates the plastic that forms so much the framework of our lives.<br /><br />We celebrate our independence from oppression here today, yet live deeply oppressed. What's the name of the boot on our neck? Desire. True independence is our awakening to our true interdependence.<br /><br />Be well,
