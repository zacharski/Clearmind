<div>With palms together,</div>  <div>Good Morning All,</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>We shared a few really nice hours with friends yesterday around and in their pool. Eating and drinking iced tea and lemonade, swimming and floating in the pool, all are good things. But the best part is sharing with others. </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Someone suggested that I should back off a little at the synagogue, that I was alienating others as a new kid on the block coming in and taking over. Its funny how organizations are so often like this. Intentions are one thing, perception is a whole other thing. Sometimes an organization grows stale,&nbsp;it languishes&nbsp;in inertia, then someone comes in and stirs the dust and all the particles get upset.&nbsp; I understand this.&nbsp; I see myself as a catalyst sometimes whose destiny is to be&nbsp;a stirrer of&nbsp;dust. &nbsp;</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Well, the dust has been stirred. I am willing to sit down and see what new  patterns emerge.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Meanwhile, the Zen Center is thriving. We had three new people from El Paso visit Sunday and were nearly at capacity.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>This is so even over the summer when people are often away for this vacation and that vacation. I am pleased. </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>We will continue to work on making this a vital center of Zen practice. Please feel free to join us.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Be well.</div><BR><BR><DIV><IMG src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/40.gif">Harvey So Daiho Hilbert, Ph.D.&nbsp;<BR>May All Beings Be Free From Suffering <BR></DIV>  <DIV>On the web at:</DIV>  <DIV><A href="http://www.daihoji.org/">http://www.daihoji.org/</A> </DIV>  <DIV><A href="http://www.zencenteroflascruces.org">http://www.zencenteroflascruces.org</A><BR>and <A href="http://daihoji.blogspot.com/">http://daihoji.blogspot.com/</A></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><p>&#32; 	 	 		<hr size=1>Want to be your own boss?
