<DIV>With palms together,</DIV>  <DIV>Good Morning All,</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>When we study the precepts, we are entering the study of moral life. We sometimes think of morality as a tricky thing.&nbsp; But I say, the only tricky part is getting caught between the things we want or don't want and wanting or not wanting them both at the same time. Of course, Philosophy 101 classes and Ethics classes are full of those arguing about what is good and what is evil.&nbsp; Or which I should do, honor the principle or support the greater good. We look to our group, family, or culture for answers.&nbsp; Is this the "Christian" thing to do?&nbsp; The Buddhist thing?&nbsp; The Jewish thing?&nbsp; We sometimes have guiding questions, "what would Jesus do?"&nbsp; Or, "what would Buddha do?"&nbsp; We look to the sources: does evil reside outside of us or inside?&nbsp; Are we born evil or good?&nbsp; Do we inherit morality? Is it us, the Adversary,&nbsp;or is it God?</DIV>   <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>So many questions.&nbsp;And while, at the time, given our age and&nbsp;circumstance, they may appear to not be useless, they are in the end, very useless questions. Because in the end, we are what we do and the measure of this is not fixed. </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>When the inside and the outside meet, that is it. Evaluation, discrimination, all are useless. They are hindrances to clear thought and action. </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>When I think of myself as a Buddhist, for example, &nbsp;I am far from Buddha. Just as if I think of myself as a Jew or Christian or Muslim, I separate myself from God. </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Morality is non-dualistic. It is just being one with the universe in thought, feeling, and action.&nbsp; When we are one with the universe, with no space for judgment, then we <EM>are</EM> the universe: not good, not bad, not right, not wrong, not pure, not defiled, not born, not dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;</DIV>   <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Be well.</DIV><BR><BR><DIV><IMG src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/40.gif">Harvey So Daiho Hilbert, Ph.D.&nbsp;<BR>May All Beings Be Free From Suffering <BR></DIV>  <DIV>On the web at:</DIV>  <DIV><A href="http://www.daihoji.org/">http://www.daihoji.org/</A> </DIV>  <DIV><A href="http://www.zencenteroflascruces.org">http://www.zencenteroflascruces.org</A><BR>and <A href="http://daihoji.blogspot.com/">http://daihoji.blogspot.com/</A></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><p>&#32; 	 	 		<hr size=1>Want to be your own boss?
