<div>With palms together,</div>  <div>Good Morning All,</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>A young lady lost her engagement ring in the grass near our courtyard yesterday.&nbsp; She spent hours out there trying to find it.&nbsp; For awhile, I searched with her, but the tiny ring was not to be found. </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>As we searched, she talked about the ring, just receiving it, her happiness, and her panic and hurt over losing it.&nbsp; Yet, she also talked about her fiance.&nbsp; How he said not to worry, that he will&nbsp;borrow a metal detector to search more deeply for it and if that failed he would just buy her another. </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Nothing was really lost.&nbsp; Nothing was really gained. Everything was revealed.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Be well.</div><BR><BR><DIV><IMG src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/40.gif">Harvey So Daiho Hilbert, Ph.D.&nbsp;<BR>May All Beings Be Free From Suffering <BR></DIV>  <DIV>On the  web at:</DIV>  <DIV><A href="http://www.daihoji.org/">http://www.daihoji.org/</A> </DIV>  <DIV><A href="http://www.zencenteroflascruces.org">http://www.zencenteroflascruces.org</A><BR>and <A href="http://daihoji.blogspot.com/">http://daihoji.blogspot.com/</A></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><p>&#32; 	 	 		<hr size=1>Want to be your own boss?
