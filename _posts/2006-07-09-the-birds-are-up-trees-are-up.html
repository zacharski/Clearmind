<DIV>With palms together,</DIV>  <DIV>Good Morning All,</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Another wonderful morning comes our way.&nbsp; I am listening to the birdsong out side the living room window. The rain we have been having has seemingly made everyone happy. The grass in the courtyard feels more alert, the trees seem taller, and clearly the birds are happy.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Have you noticed that life is like that?&nbsp; Conditions create conditions. When we are surrounded by love and nurturance, we are loving and nurturing; when we are under stress we are more brittle and anxious. Internal and external coincide. </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Yet both sides of this coin lead to our suffering.&nbsp; To be happy and wish for the conditions of happiness are as powerful sources of suffering as stress and anxiety. You say, but wait, shouldn't we be happy?&nbsp; Shouldn't we work to be happy and create the conditions for happiness?&nbsp; I say, of course.&nbsp;  In the process though, do not let go of the fact that these conditions are impermanent and will, sooner or later, cease to exist.&nbsp; </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>This means we can and should properly live only here and now. An eye toward tomorrow, a wink to the past, but fully present now. My sense is that the birds enjoy their day, whatever their day is. And the trees enjoy their day, whatever their day is. They do so because they are completely one with it.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Be well.</DIV><BR><BR><DIV><IMG src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/40.gif">Harvey So Daiho Hilbert, Ph.D.&nbsp;<BR>May All Beings Be Free From Suffering <BR></DIV>  <DIV>On the web at:</DIV>  <DIV><A href="http://www.daihoji.org/">http://www.daihoji.org/</A> </DIV>  <DIV><A href="http://www.zencenteroflascruces.org">http://www.zencenteroflascruces.org</A><BR>and <A href="http://daihoji.blogspot.com/">http://daihoji.blogspot.com/</A></DIV>   <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><p>&#32; 		<hr size=1>Yahoo!
