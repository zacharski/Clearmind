<DIV>With palms together,</DIV>  <DIV>Good Morning All,</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Enlightenment.&nbsp; Powerful word. Lots of people searching for it, most with only a vague feeling as to what it is. Which creates a question in my mind.&nbsp; If we do not have a clear idea as to what this is, why are we searching for it?</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Do we think enlightenment will make us feel better?&nbsp; Think better?&nbsp; Be better people?&nbsp; Will it make us superior to the next person?&nbsp; Will it be a sign that we are somehow special, or that we have finally arrived?</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>When you come to the practice of Zen, check your motives rather than your enlightenment. </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Seeking satori is&nbsp;a big&nbsp;problem.&nbsp; To search means that we are looking. And when we are looking, we are too busy&nbsp;to&nbsp;be present. Stop looking.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Be well.&nbsp; </DIV><BR><BR><DIV><IMG  src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/40.gif">Harvey So Daiho Hilbert, Ph.D.&nbsp;<BR>May All Beings Be Free From Suffering <BR></DIV>  <DIV>On the web at:</DIV>  <DIV><A href="http://www.daihoji.org/">http://www.daihoji.org/</A> </DIV>  <DIV><A href="http://www.zencenteroflascruces.org">http://www.zencenteroflascruces.org</A><BR>and <A href="http://daihoji.blogspot.com/">http://daihoji.blogspot.com/</A></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><p>&#32; 	 	 		<hr size=1>Want to be your own boss?
