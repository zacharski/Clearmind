<div>With palms together,</div>  <div>Good Morning All,</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Someone wrote to me recently asking about pornography the precpt regarding sexual misconduct.&nbsp; The letter was refreshingly candid and clearly presented a picture of a man working hard to understand himself and the precepts. </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Internet pornography is a huge mega-billion dollar industry. This means that a lot of people go to these site and a lots of women and men participate in conduct that creates the materials for these sites.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>The existence of this industry, like prostitution, raises a&nbsp;number of good questions about our nature, ethics, and&nbsp;our biology.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Just what is pornography, anyway?&nbsp; I was sitting in Barnes &amp; Nobles the other day with a friend and her step-daughter who was 16 going on 21. This young lady picked out a copy of Cosmo, she was wearing a very mini, mini skirt,  and was clearly suffering from raging hormones. The cover of the magazine promised information on ver specific sexual issues and questions, the pictures in the magazine were tantizingly sexual. What do we make of this?</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Is creating or viewing pornography a violation of the precepts? And if so, how? </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>When does sexual content or conduct become "misconduct"?</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>I have my own understanding of these questions, but I would like to hear yours.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Be well.&nbsp;</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div><BR><BR><DIV><IMG src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/40.gif">Harvey So Daiho Hilbert, Ph.D.&nbsp;<BR>May All Beings Be Free From Suffering <BR></DIV>  <DIV>On the web at:</DIV>  <DIV><A href="http://www.daihoji.org/">http://www.daihoji.org/</A> </DIV>  <DIV><A href="http://www.zencenteroflascruces.org">http://www.zencenteroflascruces.org</A><BR>and <A  href="http://daihoji.blogspot.com/">http://daihoji.blogspot.com/</A></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><p>&#32; 	 	 		<hr size=1>Want to be your own boss?
