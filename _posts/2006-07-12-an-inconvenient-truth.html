<div>With Palms Together,</div>  <div>Good Morning All,</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>We saw An Inconvenient Truth last night. Al Gore should receive a medal for his efforts with his slide show and this film.&nbsp; It is a deeply challenging film, scary, yet hopeful.&nbsp; And a moral statement about us as a species. </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Many people feel politics and religion do not mix.&nbsp; I have been one of them.&nbsp; Yet, on closer inspection, ethics and morality are at the heart of both so how do we really separate them? I believe most people who say this, are using a rather narrow understanding of "political"&nbsp;to mean American politics, democrat, republican, independent, or green parties.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Al Gore believes this environment crisis is not a political issue, per se, &nbsp;but a moral one. I agree with this when using a lessor definition of politics.&nbsp; Yet, when it comes to what to do with the moral question and  challenge, we are left with ethics and ethics demand action. Individual action and social action.&nbsp; Social action is by definition political as it is done within a body politic. </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Our religious commitments are the nexus between the individual and the community, the community and the universe, the univesre and the Universal. &nbsp;</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>If you have not seen this film, I urge you to see it.&nbsp; I saw yesterday that Gore has a book just released by the same title.&nbsp; Read it.&nbsp; Get involved on some level large or small: this is your planet and your planet is the home of all of your generations. </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div><A href="http://www.participate.net/campaigns">http://www.participate.net/campaigns</A></div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Be well,</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div><BR><BR><DIV><IMG src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/40.gif">Harvey So Daiho Hilbert,  Ph.D.&nbsp;<BR>May All Beings Be Free From Suffering <BR></DIV>  <DIV>On the web at:</DIV>  <DIV><A href="http://www.daihoji.org/">http://www.daihoji.org/</A> </DIV>  <DIV><A href="http://www.zencenteroflascruces.org">http://www.zencenteroflascruces.org</A><BR>and <A href="http://daihoji.blogspot.com/">http://daihoji.blogspot.com/</A></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><p>&#32; 	 	 		<hr size=1>Want to be your own boss?
