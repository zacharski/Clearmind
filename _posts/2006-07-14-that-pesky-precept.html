<DIV>With palms together,</DIV>  <DIV>Good Morning All,</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>We have brains, hearts, lungs, stomachs, kidneys, penises and/or clitorises. Just as our organs like the brain and heart function without our saying much about it, so too, the others. Yet, just so: because the motor is running does not mean we must put it in gear and step on the gas.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Second. We live in a natural world.&nbsp; Nothing evil or good exists independent of us.&nbsp; We create evil and good by our actions, and our evaluations of those actions. In the end, it is our intent that creates our karma. </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Third. If we are using sexual conduct for healthy reasons, that is, for improving our mental and emotional states, or reproducing, then our intent is a benefit.&nbsp; If, on the other hand, this behavior is rooted in a desire to harm, to control or punish, then we are using sexuality as a tool for harm and in so doing,  creating evil. </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Pornography, by itself, as pictures or film, is neutral. It is like the rock under my foot.&nbsp; Or the thought in my head.&nbsp; It means nothing by itself.&nbsp; We add to it with that thought and then create evil or good with our action. </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Fourth.&nbsp; The industry of pornography is a whole other matter and thus a matter for us. If we say that smoking is harmful, then those who produce the product we smoke have a role to play in the responsibility equation. When a film portrays violence for the sake of glamorizing violence and thus, promoting violence, it is creating evil.&nbsp; Just so, pornography. We have a responsibility in consuming such material in that sense. </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Lastly, life is complex.&nbsp; We are all infants in the process, learning as we go.&nbsp; Sometimes our best efforts at understanding and doing the right thing are either not good enough or, in the  worst case scenario (like a righteous war) short term fixes to long term problems. We should not punish ourselves for our behavior.&nbsp; Rather we should learn from it and do better. </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>I cannot tell you what better is, only you and your heart and the faces of those you love (or hate) can do that.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;Be well.</DIV><BR><BR><DIV><IMG src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/40.gif">Harvey So Daiho Hilbert, Ph.D.&nbsp;<BR>May All Beings Be Free From Suffering <BR></DIV>  <DIV>On the web at:</DIV>  <DIV><A href="http://www.daihoji.org/">http://www.daihoji.org/</A> </DIV>  <DIV><A href="http://www.zencenteroflascruces.org">http://www.zencenteroflascruces.org</A><BR>and <A href="http://daihoji.blogspot.com/">http://daihoji.blogspot.com/</A></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><p>&#32; 		<hr size=1>Do you Yahoo!?<br>  Get on board. <a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/evt=40791/*http://advision.webevents.yahoo.com/handraisers">You're invited</a> to try the new Yahoo!
