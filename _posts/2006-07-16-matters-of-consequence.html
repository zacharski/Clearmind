<DIV>With palms together,</DIV>  <DIV>Good Morning All,</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>The rain came down hard last night. I watched it from my living room as it soaked the ground. It is a real blessing to witness rain fall. Water is so precious. So much of life's preciousness goes unnoticed when we are not present to witness it.&nbsp; We are often not present for such things because our attention is distracted by 'matters of consequence.' And yet, like The Little Prince, we should stay aware that it is the simplest things that are of the deepest consequence.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>A rain, a shining sun, the feel of our feet on the ground: these are matters of consequence.&nbsp; The water we drink, the food we eat, the clothes we wear: these are matters of consequence. The love in our life, the hate in our life, and our practice with them: these are matters of consequence.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>So we practice to pay attention.&nbsp; We practice to witness  true matters of consequence, allowing our witness to nurture the good and burn away the evil.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>This is not difficult. Do it now.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Be well.</DIV><BR><BR><DIV><IMG src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/40.gif">Harvey So Daiho Hilbert, Ph.D.&nbsp;<BR>May All Beings Be Free From Suffering <BR></DIV>  <DIV>On the web at:</DIV>  <DIV><A href="http://www.daihoji.org/">http://www.daihoji.org/</A> </DIV>  <DIV><A href="http://www.zencenteroflascruces.org">http://www.zencenteroflascruces.org</A><BR>and <A href="http://daihoji.blogspot.com/">http://daihoji.blogspot.com/</A></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><p>&#32; 	 	 		<hr size=1>Want to be your own boss?
