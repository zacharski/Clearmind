With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />When we pray for peace, what are we doing?  What does it mean, to "pray" for peace?  Prayer is typically thought of as an appeal to God or to a government, or some other such authority.<br /><br />But this is not always so.<br /><br />An appeal suggests a disconnect between two or more parties. If we are one, then what would prayer be?<br /><br />I see prayer as less an appeal to Other than as a modeling of the thing itself. To pray for peace thus becomes modeling peace. To pray for non-violence becomes modeling non-violence.  To pray for the health of others means modeling healthy living.  And so on.<br /><br />When we pray this way, we are expressing the true nature of things.<br /><br />Be well.
