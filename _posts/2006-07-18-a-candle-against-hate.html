With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />May all beings be free from suffering. A simple prayer, yet so challenging. When people hate us enough to kill us, and do so with glee, it is quite natural to want to kill them first. Natural, but not kind. Natural, but not correct. Natural, but not good enough.<br /><br />I read a prayer this morning from a religious list that essentially petitioned God to punish our enemies. I was struck by this.  It was an opening statement on a ethics text commentary.<br /><br />When we ask God to take sides, we are our discerning self to take sides.  The process of taking sides divides humanity into lumps: those we like, and those we don't like. Simple enough on its surface, but in the end it is very dangerous, as it is very easy to be tempted to see those we don't like as somehow different from us, less than us, or just plain evil.<br /><br />People who hate are people who suffer. When we pray for an end to suffering we must pray for an end to hate, especially within ourselves. Hate has a place to germinate when we close ourselves off.  Hate loves the darkness of ignorance.  It thrives in the shadows.<br /><br />Today, light a candle specifically for illuminating the dark places of your heart. Place your attention on the light of that small flame.  Witness its steady warmth. One small flame, one large light.<br /><br />Be well.
