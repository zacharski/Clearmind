With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />Being in suffering, I walk recklessly. Being in suffering, my attention is on my pain.  Being in suffering, I need to escape my pain. Being in suffering I cannot feel for others.<br /><br />Being at peace, I walk lightly upon the earth.  Being at peace, I am mindful of my actions and my speech.  Being at peace, love has an opportunity to exist.<br /><br />Through practice, develop the wisdom and insight to know these are both seeds within each of us and that they are of the same source.  Our path is to begin with one and conclude with the other.<br /><br />Be well.
