With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />If we keep a piece of fruit too long without enjoying it, it becomes unenjoyable. Nothing can be saved for very long: the universal processes, revealing the truth of impermanence, cannot be stopped. Yet we try. <em>My</em>, do we try.<br /><br />Trying to stop change is like refusing the Universal. Here comes the flood, let's stop it!  Right!<br /><br />If we are "lucky" or willing to work hard, we might slow it down, yet in the process, it is interesting to note, we lose touch with that which we <em>are <strong>now</strong></em> because our attention is directed toward keeping change from happening.<br /><br />Enjoy this moment, as it is. If you are exercising, you are enjoying your exercise, not working to forestall a weakened future! If you are eating healthy, enjoy eating healthy, not the thought that you are pushing away cancer or some other dread inevitability.<br /><br />Take a bite of life and savor it!<br /><br />Be well.
