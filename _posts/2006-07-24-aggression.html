With palms Together,<br />Good Day All,<br /><br />Aggression will get us no where but to the fires of hell.  Those who fire the first shot, those who fire the last shot, all will be brothers and sisters there. In times of great pain and suffering we must commit ourselves to great peace and compassion.<br /><br />Arriving at such a place is a whole other matter.<br /><br />Along the path of peace and compassion come attempts to stir us. Threats to our well-being, arguement, rumor, gossip, people taking advantage of our generosity or our compassion, all of these are serious challenges.  Yet, we persist.<br /><br />We persist because we know that our peace and our compassion are not relative, but absolute.  They are our true nature. Cultivate this nature. Nurture it. Embrace it.<br /><br />Be well.
