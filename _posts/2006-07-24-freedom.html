With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />May all beings be free from suffering. <br /><br />I repeat this short prayer every time I put my palms together in gassho. It is attached to each email post.  Like the Tibetan prayer wheel, it is launched by my breath and my touch into the universe.<br /><br />I recognize that this being, "I", am a suffering being, with all suffering beings. In truth we are one being completely.  So to free one being, frees all beings, just as my behavior defines a set of possibilities for all other human beings, and their behavior, mine. There were great and fundamental truth in the basic statements of the existentialists.<br /><br />Just so, it is not enough to say, we must do.  In the doing we are being, never becoming.We are what we do.<br /><br />So, this morning "do" love, "do" peace, "do" complete oneness.<br /><br />These things then become realities for us all.<br /><br />Be well.
