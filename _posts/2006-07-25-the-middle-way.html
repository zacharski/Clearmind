With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />In all things we should live in the middle. Extremes are a serious problem for both religious and secular life, as if the two can really be separated. Cutting off the heads of our enemies, burning a cross in the front of a home, bombing a church or mosque, blowing up centuries old Buddha statues are not the acts of a spiritually based people, but rather the acts of bigots who are essentially spiritual vampires.  They live off the life of others.<br /><br />The Middle Way is neither black nor white.  It is not Buddhist, not Christian, not Jewish, not Muslim, not Hindu, not Wicca...it is a way. We practice the Middle way by serene reflection. Allow things to rise and fall away, Doing what is before us to do.  Adding as little as possible of ourselves to the mix, we enjoy the moment for what it is.<br /><br />Be well.
