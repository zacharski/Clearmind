With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />As the sun rises, its light illuminates our atmosphere creating our sky and hiding the stars beyond. Therefore, we can say that sometimes the light of day is a hindrance. Truth does not depend on light, it is in itself. Do not be deceived by the light, nor confused by the darkness. Light and dark are but two views of the same reality.<br /><br />Life requires an open heart and deep faith. Practice being present with both.<br /><br />Be well.
