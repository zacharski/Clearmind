With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />Yesterday through much of the afternoon, I was six years old. I played with a young friend in the pool, we ran in a circle in the courtyard, we played on the floor of the apartment while the adults looked on. We are never too old to see with a child's eye. Our imagination is still a very powerful tool.<br /><br />I was a Mighty Morphin' Shark, a Bubble Blowin' Jellyfish, and a Floating Log within minutes. And when my little friend had to go home, I became a husband and grandfather again.<br /><br />These are but roles we play, limited only by our willingness to be ourselves. We can too often allow our limits to encrust us in tradition; age us before our time.<br /><br />When that happens, go find a six year old to play with.<br /><br />Be well. <p></p>
