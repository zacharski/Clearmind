With palms together,<br />Good Morning all,<br /><br />Hate is a powerful poison.  It fills us with such negative energy.  It demands harmful action and  evil behavior. The Buddha said that the antidote to hate was love. Only love will stop hate, yet loving those who would do us harm is so difficult.<br /><br />Yesterday I had occasion to read several web logs from Muslims. The common theme seemed to be that Jews were not human.  Then I read about the man who walked into a Jewish Federation Building, claimed he was a Muslim and shot six people including women.<br /><br />Sometimes when confronted with such things, I remain silent. I take in the pain of the situation and let it sit with me.  Rivers of feeling rush by.  Irrational thoughts. Hurtful feelings. I remain silent.<br /><br />In this silence I begin to understand that point of view is everything. Those who are oppressed, hungry, and powerless will hate those whom they perceive to be well-fed, powerful, and rich.  No amount of sharing, goodwill gestures, or outreach will resolve such deep and powerful feelings.<br /><br />In such cases and in such moments, my prayers must be directed toward myself. Recognizing my anger, I can recognize theirs.  Recognizing my hate, I can recognize theirs.  Recognizing my suffering, I can recognize theirs.  It is through this recognition, that our humanity is actualized.  For it is true that we can all hate, then it is equally true that we can all love.  If it is true that we can all be anger, then it is equally true that we can all be peace.<br /><br />So, we begin within ourselves and step outside. Honor your neighbor, love your enemy, and desire peace.<br /><br />Be well.
