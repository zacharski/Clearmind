With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />True Bodhisattvas do only that which is before them to do. This is because they live in the real world directly, manifesting themselves in the behavior of the moment.  No need to go across the universe when they and the universe are one.<br /><br />So, as we go through our day, pick up that piece of trash someone dropped on the ground, clean the lint filter of the laundry machine, flush your toilet in the public restroom, wash your hands often, be respectful of what you eat, honor the air you breathe, and offer a stranger your smile.<br /><br />Make yourself a healing balm against an open wound.<br /><br />Be well.
