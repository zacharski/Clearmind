<DIV>With palms together,</DIV>  <DIV>Good Morning All,</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>We are sitting in the Ft. Lauderdale airport and I thought I would post my morning note while waiting for the aircraft to board. I have been reading closely the Eight Gates of Zen by Daido Loori.&nbsp; It is a rich text, well worth the study. </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>He said something about liturgy being a method we have in Zen of connecting or actualizing the spiritual with the everyday.&nbsp; He argues that Master Dogen did this when he re-invented the Zen liturgy back in the 13Th century. </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>By liturgy is meant not just the morning and evening services, the sutras, and the vows.&nbsp; But in a much larger sense, the gathas we recite upon opening a sutra, washing our face, shaving our heads, ea ting, brushing our teeth.&nbsp; Even wider, the mindful attention we place on our every move, thought, feeling, through the day.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>   <DIV>To live a Zen life is to live a life awake to the details of the everyday.&nbsp; We know the Universe in in those details. And each detail is an opportunity for complete, unexcelled awakening.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Be well.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><BR><BR><DIV><IMG src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/40.gif">Harvey So Daiho Hilbert, Ph.D.&nbsp;<BR>May All Beings Be Free From Suffering <BR></DIV>  <DIV>On the web at:</DIV>  <DIV><A href="http://www.daihoji.org/">http://www.daihoji.org/</A> </DIV>  <DIV><A href="http://www.zencenteroflascruces.org">http://www.zencenteroflascruces.org</A><BR>and <A href="http://daihoji.blogspot.com/">http://daihoji.blogspot.com/</A></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><p>&#32;__________________________________________________<br>Do You Yahoo!?<br>Tired of spam?
