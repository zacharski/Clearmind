With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />As we have all read, and some of us practice, to study the Way is to study the self. This has particular meaning for us. It means we must be aware of our responses to the universe as it presents itself. How do we hear our fellow man?  How do we read text on a computer screen?  What do we add?  What do we take away?<br /><br />Lists such as this offer us a unique practice opportunity. We can take on roles. We can speak from the heart.  We can practice deep listening.  We can be compassionate.  We can be hurtful. Our choices should be our teachers.<br /><br />Just so in our everyday discourse.  Investigating how we interact with our spouse is every bit as important as how we interact with each other in a Zendo, perhaps more.<br /><br />Being a Buddha is not a part time job, nor is it contained to certain media.<br /><br />A deep bow to each of you,
