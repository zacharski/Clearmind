With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />I have spent the last couple of days with the <em>Eihei Shingi</em>, Dogen's work on the rules for monastic life. What I come out of this study with is the sense that <em>respect</em> is key.<br /><br />Our ability to respect, however, comes only with serious practice.  We must be willing to set ourselves aside along with our notions and values, our ideas and beliefs and what we know in order to respect the person in front of us. And we do so simply because he is there.<br /><br />It is our job to find the Buddha-nature within him, not his job to show us where it is.<br /><br />Be well.
