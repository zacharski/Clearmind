With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />The world is all a-jitter. Terrorists, terror threats, wars: all before our eyes 24/7. I wonder about the impact of such things on our human psyche. How does one live in constant fear and remain a human being? One doesn't.<br /><br />The truth is, its all noise.<br /><br />An abundance of caution is just a way of justifying giving sway to fear. Caution, good; an abundance, not so good. In an abundance of anything we swim in craziness. Each voice ramping up the next until there's nothing left but the shrill whine of terror itself. We clone each other.<br /><br />So here's what to do. Nothing.  Doing nothing is always best.  Just as there is thunder in silence, so there is peace in vast emptiness. Let the voices rant, be peace in the rage. Smile a lot.  Smiling helps. Bow a lot.  Humility is always a good thing.<br /><br />In a placid pond, stones are swallowed whole.<br /><br />Be well.
