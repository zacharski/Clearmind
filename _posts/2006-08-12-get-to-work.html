With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />The world is suffering. Each of us is witness and participant. Yet, what are we really doing about it? From the silence of our deepest practice arises the deepest compassion. How so?  Because from our deepest practice comes the deepest realization that everything is one, so that when one suffers all suffer; when one is joyful, all are joyful.  When one dies, all die.<br /><br />Not becoming attached to one state of being or another does not mean ignoring a problem when it presents itself.  It does not mean becoming stoic and quiet and withdrawing to the mountains. As Master Dogen points out, even the green mountains walk.<br /><br />As I sat at the Peace Vigil this past Wednesday, I was heartened by the drivers who honked in our support, but was dismayed by the severe lack of people on the line with us.  At Zen Center  andat the synagogue I am struck by the lack of attendance. At the soup kitchen, where are the food donations that should be overwhelming the pantry's ability to contain them? At the child care centers and homeless shelters, where are the goods, services, and people that will repair the wounded in our communities?<br /><br />We are a world of great wealth and great intelligence and yet the distribution of basic necessities, as well as social justice is askew. We are a world now embattled by fundamentalism and the fear that drives it. We see the images and want to turn away. <br /><br />I say turn away, go ahead!  Stop the poison from entering your heart.  But then turn to something!  You want to reduce suffering?  Get to work!<br /><br />Be well.
