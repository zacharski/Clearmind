With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />Offering a stick of incense this morning, I bowed and affirmed that all beings be free from suffering. I say affirmed because all too often when we talk about prayer we are talking as we and the thing we are praying for (and to) are somehow different or apart.<br /><br />Prayer is not just a request.  In its highest form its an affirmation of non-duality. Just as we resolve a paradox by becoming the paradox, resolve a koan by becoming the koan, so too, we pray.<br /><br />So, we could say, I pray for peace.  Or we could say, I become peace. Or better still, I realize peace. The truest statement is the statement that most reduces the divide between subject and object.<br /><br />While our language, hardwired in duality, is a tall barrier to our full realization, our practice can be a hammer breaking down that barrier.<br /><br />Peace.<br /><br />Be well.
