<DIV>With palms together,</DIV>  <DIV>Good Morning All,</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>A fragile peace, and there is no other kind, has been achieved in Lebanon and Israel. How wonderful!&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us all work together to maintain it. Peace is always fragile because life hurts. We don't enjoy suffering and try to stop ourselves from suffering by force. This just increases the suffering of all concerned. A cycle of violence and injury emerges and takes on a life of its own. </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>To stop it we must find a way to accept the blows of others, verbal or physical, and accept them in such a way as to both survive ourselves and nurture our enemies in the process.&nbsp; Love erodes hatred.&nbsp; It is like anti-toxin.&nbsp; But is slow working, demanding, and very difficult to produce in the face of hatred.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Still, we must learn this practice.&nbsp; All of us.&nbsp; We must stop taking the violent steps that we take  believing they will make us safe, and take the far more courageous steps of loving-kindness.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>We do this with practice. We do this with love. We do this because we don't have any other choice.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Be well.</DIV><BR><BR><DIV><IMG src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/40.gif">Harvey So Daiho Hilbert, Ph.D.&nbsp;<BR>May All Beings Be Free From Suffering <BR></DIV>  <DIV>On the web at:</DIV>  <DIV><A href="http://www.daihoji.org/">http://www.daihoji.org/</A> </DIV>  <DIV><A href="http://www.zencenteroflascruces.org">http://www.zencenteroflascruces.org</A><BR>and <A href="http://daihoji.blogspot.com/">http://daihoji.blogspot.com/</A></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><p>&#32; 	 	 		<hr size=1>Want to be your own boss?
