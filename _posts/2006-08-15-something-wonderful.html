With palms together,<br />Good Morning (barely) All,<br /><br />Our window is open and the gardeners are taking a break from their work. It is such a delight to sit here and look out a window onto the courtyard.  It is green and there are a few trees.  We have picnic tables and tall grasses with even taller plumes. It rained earlier and the air is clean and fresh. I wish you could be here to experience this with me. Yet, we each have our own beauty to experience, don't we?<br /><br />It is so important to stop for a bit and take note of it. In our rush to get here and there, we often miss the simple, natural, beauty that surrounds us. Beauty is everywhere: even in the darkest places. We only need open our eyes and hearts to see and experience it.<br /><br />Often in the midst of conflict, stress, or suffering of some sort or other, we are so overwhelmed with the difficulty that we just want to close our eyes and make the world go away.  Not the best approach, I'm afraid. The world will remain forever. It is our problems that will go away.<br /><br />What we need to do in such circumstances is work hard to take a moment to see something wonderful there in front of us.  Nothing there?  Think again. There is always something wonderful.  Always.<br /><br />Be well.
