With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />Have you ever met a person who has had the sense knocked into him?<br /><br />I have.  These people tend to be bitter, resentful, deceitful, and act out of fear.<br /><br />What is one man's terrorist is another man's liberation fighter. Its all in the point of view.  Yet we insist that we can win a war on terror. Hmmm. How should we best go about that? Knock some sense into their heads?<br /><br />We need to realize that each "war" we seem to engage in (and we love this metaphor for action here in America) requires the appropriate tools.  Just as a "war" on hunger does not require Stealth Bombers. A "war" on terror would benefit from a set of tools that might diffuse the terrorist's motivation and support.<br /><br />So, what motivates a "terrorist"?  Ahhh, the problem begins to crystallize. We have no real clue, since we put them all in the same box and mark them up as terrorists. So, this is a one tool fits all war. And the tool is "kill."  Rather like that old Arlo Guthrie refrain in Alice's Restaurant, and just so, reveals a level of insanity caused by our unwillingness to talk with people we disagree with or don't understand.<br /><br />There are lessons for life in this.<br /><br />Talk with people.  Invite them to sit down with you. Listen without packaging up their thoughts before they have left their mouths. Find the commonalities of experience and needs.  Be flexible and creative in addressing issues.  One tool rarely fits all things.  That's why we have soooo many tools.<br /><br />In the end, it will be our willingness to understand our enemies that will make them our friends. Life is like that.<br /><br />Be well.
