With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />We have been receiving rain.  Lots of rain.  In the desert, rain is both a blessing and a curse.  Since it doesn't rain often, the ground is not receptive to the water. The water hits the ground and bounces. Then flows. Then rages through arroyos. We should all learn from this.<br /><br />The lesson?  The ground must be both prepared and willing to receive.<br /><br />What does this mean for us?  We are a lot like that ground. We harden and dry up.  We fail to receive in our hardness and defensiveness. <br /><br />To receive the blessings of a wet world, we must prepare ourselves to be watered.  This means we must do the hard work of reflection and examination.  We must be willing to dig up the rocks of our past and expose them to the light of day.  We must be willing to aerate our soil with dialog. So when the waters of life do visit us, we are both ready and have the space to receive them.<br /><br />Be well,
