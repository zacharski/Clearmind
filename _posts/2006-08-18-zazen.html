With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />This morning's zazen was made a special event by the presence of our founding Teachers Ken and Fern Roshi. Vicki and I had already completed the opening chants as they slipped in, sat erect, and immediately requested the Kyosaku. Ever on my Ino toes, I raised the stick and smacked them on their shoulders each in their turn.<br /><br />Sitting down once more, mountains became mountains, and rivers became rivers.<br /><br />The Zendo Shoji screens are now complete.  The shoe box is being built and is paid for. We discussed finishing touches for the Zen Center physical plant.  We discussed teaching and our various points of view. All with tea in hand and a joyful heart.<br /><br />Be well,
