<div>With&nbsp; palms together,</div>  <div>Good Morning All,</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>The other day, we three roshi's were at the Zendo by ourselves. It was early in the morning after the morning sit. Ken-roshi was installing the shoji screen behind the alter, Fern-roshi and I were talking in the kitchen about our Zen and the progress of our Zen Center.&nbsp; I sat on the floor, she sat in a chair.&nbsp; </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>We recognized and honored our differing styles of both teaching and understanding. Noticed subtle differences in our students. It was such a nurturing moment.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Some of us take a philosophical approach, some are sitting atop that hundred foot pole living in vast emptiness, others are moving along in the everyday world. Each has an offering.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>This morning I have been invited to&nbsp;visit Unity Church to recognize the Buddhadharma there. It is a wonderful opportunity to  share.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>The Great Buddha Way is large indeed.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Be well.</div><BR><BR><DIV><IMG src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/40.gif">Harvey So Daiho Hilbert, Ph.D.&nbsp;<BR>May All Beings Be Free From Suffering <BR></DIV>  <DIV>On the web at:</DIV>  <DIV><A href="http://www.daihoji.org/">http://www.daihoji.org/</A> </DIV>  <DIV><A href="http://www.zencenteroflascruces.org">http://www.zencenteroflascruces.org</A><BR>and <A href="http://daihoji.blogspot.com/">http://daihoji.blogspot.com/</A></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><p>&#32; 	 	 		<hr size=1>Want to be your own boss?
