<DIV>With palms together,</DIV>  <DIV>Good Morning All,</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Consider your every movement, your every words, thought and deed are teachings. What is&nbsp;their essence?&nbsp; If, as was once said, the medium is the message, what is your message?</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>I see our children wearing t-shirts that suggest they are selfish or sex toys.&nbsp; I see parents not paying attention to much of anything but what's on their table. I see people equating prosperity with election (to use an old Calvinist sort of thought). </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Yet, this obsession with the pleasures of the self noticeably leaves us feeling both empty and oddly angry. We seek fulfillment (a spiritual sort of&nbsp;meal) in Church or Synagogue or Mosque or Zendo and are angry when we leave still craving.&nbsp; Not understanding that seeking is a sort of sickness in itself. We blame the form or the Teaching or the Teacher.&nbsp; Sometimes we hold the  Universe responsible. It is rare that we really get into it, though.&nbsp; Rare that we look at our own medium and assess or own message.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Perhaps it it time we considered rethinking the notion of looking "the other way" and saw that "way" as our own life.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Be well.&nbsp;</DIV><BR><BR><DIV><IMG src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/40.gif">Rev.
