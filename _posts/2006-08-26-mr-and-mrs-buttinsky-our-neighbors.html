<div>With palms together,</div>  <div>Good Morning All,</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>I went to the synagogue last night.&nbsp; There was a young man on his way to graduate study at a rabbinic school.&nbsp; He gave a talk.&nbsp; Big Mistake. He chose to talk about the Ways of Rebuke. Now, imagine a congregation full of people much older than you and you are telling them how to rebuke their neighbor.&nbsp; Either in one ear and out the other or a rebuke in itself. He could have cast the talk in much more positive terms by suggesting we consider rebuke to be correction or assistance or counsel or whatever, but no.&nbsp; He stuck to the old, archaic term, rebuke...of course, its a Hebrew word and rabbis, as well as rabbinic students love to talk on the derivations of terms. I can't blame them, I do the same with Zen words. Such talk makes us feel as though we are in the know, you know.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>I was struck, however, with the history that rebuking our  neighbor is a positive commandment and is considered a good thing to do. This commandment places all of us in a position of being the hall monitors at school, the crossing guards, and the parents of the world around us.&nbsp; It sets us up to be the experts judging our neighbor's behavior and then demands we become a buttinskies on top of it! Oy.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Yes, we should aproach those who we feel are injuring us or the world.&nbsp; Yes, we should attempt to repair the damage, assist them and ourselves in healing, but rebuke?&nbsp; I'm not so sure. </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>The Buddha taught that teachings must be specific to the situation and needs of those within the situation.&nbsp; He knew that not all of us are smart, nor are we all artistic or mechanical.&nbsp; Each of us needs to be approached in a careful way, a way appropriate to our ability to understand.&nbsp; This requires a great knowledge of our neighbor.&nbsp; Sadly, few of us  bother to get to know our neighbors well enough. And fewer still have the skill to rebuke with care and compassion. </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>So, I wonder about this commandment and am left thinking it better to address oneself before addressing the flaws of others.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Be well.</div><BR><BR><DIV><IMG src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/40.gif">Rev.
