<div>With palms together,</div>  <div>Good Morning All,</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>This morning I am so sleepy.&nbsp;I thouht of the story about Suzuki-roshi training himself to literally jump out if bed each morning. Sometimes life is like that. It demands our attention in spite of ourselves.&nbsp; So few of us seem willing to snap to it, though.&nbsp; Our tendencies are to give in to our body's base urges: eat more, sleep more, exercise less, park as close to the store entrance as possible, eat fast foods, anything to avoid doing that which we do not feel like doing.&nbsp; Oh terror.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>No&nbsp;wonder others see us as a soft bunch. </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>One of the qualities of awakened living is having the discipline&nbsp;to be awake.&nbsp; And to be awake means most directly to be present, even if, especially if, we don't want to.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>So, maybe that is what we need in our lives, an internal mindful bell  that rings and sometimes gently, sometimes demandingly, brings us to attention.&nbsp;But for what?</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>What is the "so what? of our practice?</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Why be awake when we so naturally wish to be asleep?&nbsp; Fit when we would rather be unfit? </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Our answer is precisely in the question.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Be well.</div><BR><BR><DIV><IMG src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/40.gif">Rev.
