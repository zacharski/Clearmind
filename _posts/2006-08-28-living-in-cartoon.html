With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />The 5:00 AM bell seemed to come right on time this morning.  Awake, I hit the floor and dressed for a morning walk with My Little Honey and the pups. Off we went before the light came over the mountains. I did a power sort of walk ahead with Tripper who seems to run standing still. We did 1.8 miles.  A quick shower and off to Zen Center for morning zazen. Vicky was there with me and the Center was so blissfully quiet.<br />From there to home. I fixed a problem with our sutra book and will print new inserts for both the Heart Sutra and the Hanya Shin Gyo pages (larger print and a bell placement). A trip to the gym for a chest, back, and ab workout, then breakfast of a protein shake and two slices of whole wheat toast with a small glass of V-8 juice completed my morning.<br /><br />Now, its time to blog.<br /><br />We had a nice turn out at Zen Center yesterday and a great lunch afterwards.  Thank you everyone.<br /><br />Whoops!  Out of the corner of my eye the top of the kitty litter box scrambled in a panic across the hall!  It seems Tripper, the ever eager litter eater (yuk!) got himself caught inside the box, freaked, and ran with the top over him. Goodness.<br /><br />What a morning.<br /><br />Be well.
