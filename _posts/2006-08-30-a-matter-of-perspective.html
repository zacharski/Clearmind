With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />We are just matter and energy aware of itself. Knowing our beginning, we see no beginning; knowing our end, we see no end.<br /><br />Because this is so, you and I, my coffee cup and the coffee within it are all one.  Because of this, yesterday today and tomorrow are one. Yet, not always so, to borrow a phrase from Suzuki-roshi.<br /><br />Always there is awareness.  Awareness can be universal or particular depending on where it is placed. Just as when we look at a television screen, the screen occupies the room, but when we look at a photograph of us looking at a television, the television is but a small part of the picture.<br /><br />As we move through our day, it is good practice to deliberately shift our perspectives of awareness.  When angry or intensely joyful, open your awareness perspective.  When working in detail, close your perspective.   We should practice to do this easily and freely.<br /><br />And in such practice, our playful, joyful, compassionate Buddhanature arises.<br /><br />Be well.
