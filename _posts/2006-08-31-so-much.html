With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />Waking to rain again this morning.  This time it is the steady sort of rain that soaks into the ground and offers refreshment to life. I know, still, that this gentle rain could create serious problems though, as the water from the mountains gains speed and comes crashing through the arroyos.  When they overflow, we have much flooding.<br /><br />Local towns have been devestated by such flooding of late.<br /><br />Too much of a good thing causes as much suffering as too little of that thing. A middle way is the way through suffering. We experience our pain, but not not hold it.  We experience our love, but do not hold it.  Then, like a ship's rudder knows but does not hinder or try to possess the water, we move smoothly through the waters of our lives.<br /><br />Not everyday can be a day of joy, not every moment can be appreciated.  A wise person realizes a value, but does not possess it. He guides himself with his priorities and practices, but is not mastered by them.<br /><br />When the floods come, we stay afloat, then do what we can to repair the damage and move on with our lives.  Receive everything. Hold nothing.<br /><br />Be well.
