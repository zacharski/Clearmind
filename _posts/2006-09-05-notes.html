With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />This morning we went out early to have our blood drawn at a laboratory as part of our annual physicals. Overnight fasting meant nothing to eat or drink this morning: no tea, no coffee, no breakfast, no morning pills. Zero, nada, goodness.<br /><br />The nurse at the lab was a very cheerful woman who had been an Army Medic. She was impressed with the scar on my head. War stories. One never has to go to far to hear them. The thing is, these days they are often about what happens after discharge and how our country fails its veterans. We shared easily together.<br /><br />Then home for a nice breakfast of scrambled eggs with mushrooms and peas, yogurt and whole wheat toast, and of course a cup of coffee. Tripper enjoyed waiting eagerly for anything that would come his way in the preparation. I thought of all the hands and lives that went into bring this food to us as I shared with both Tripper and Pepper.<br /><br />My Little Honey ate quickly and went off to knit with the ladies of the Stitch &amp; Bitch group. Knitting is her Zen practice, and a good one it is, too. I am here with Tripper, Pepper, and Pete. I think its time for a walk, but first the dishes.<br /><br />The clouds are dark, but not looking all that much as though they will open up on us. At least not just yet. We are recovering from these rains in small steps. The Zen Center's ceiling has to dry out. We will do our sesshin in Cloudcroft at my Teacher's Zendo.<br /><br />But just now a small cup of hot white tea and do the dishes.<br /><br />Be well.
