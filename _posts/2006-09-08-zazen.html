With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />Zazen this morning was a quiet affair. I sat alone in the Ino's seat chanting and ringing the bells. Then silence in the upright posture. Zazen is a silent and deeply quieting practice, through the practice periods themselves can be riotous.  In the end, just as the breath finds its own rhythm so do our minds.<br /><br />I read a piece in Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind a short while ago that caught my attention.  Suzuki suggested that talking about the philosophy of Zen was a little blasphemous. He pointed out that talking about what you do not realize is wrong headed. I suggest it is a little like putting the cart before the horse, or curtainly like mistaking a picture for a thing.<br /><br />So, what is Buddhism? Sit zazen.<br /><br />Be well.
