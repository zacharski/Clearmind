With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />To the untrained student, spiritual practice and practical practice seem to be two different things. Spiritual practice makes us feel good, relaxed, special, closer to the Infinite, whatever; Practical practice encounters the real world and considers its dangers, as well as its needs and benefits. While this may sometime seems to be so, it is not always so, and in the final analysis, is never so.<br /><br />When we practice this way, we think we must go to a special place to practice, dress in a special way, take on a special attitude and posture, and so on, in order to be spiritual. Then when we leave that place we can take on the attitude and posture of the real world, thus justifying our need to be unjust, cruel, and self-centered.<br /><br />Zen does not differentiate between these two worlds. The Master walks in both at the same time, recognizing what needs to be done and doing it, does so with mind like water, thus revealing the truth, that there is only one world.<br /><br />Buddhist values are practical values. Generosity ends suffering; morality ends harm; patience encourages success; diligence increases endurance; meditation creates receptivity; and wisdom manifests the whole. It is only when we understand what we are doing through the narrow eyes of the self, that these seem impractical.<br /><br />When a stone is tossed into the water, the water embraces it.<br /><br />Be well.
