With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />Its a nice Sunday morning and the air is wonderfully cool. Summer is clearly coming to a close. The passing seasons can be gentle reminders of the changing nature of things. Change is rarely sudden, though sometimes it can seem so. More often than not, change simply happens in small increments, detectable only when we pay attention.<br /><br />Zazen teaches us to pay attention. When we practice zazen we choose to keep our attention focused, our body and mind join together in this focus, and soon, there is nothing but attention.<br /><br />In this attention resides our True Nature. What is this Nature?  Attention itself. <br /><br />As the sun dims, the flower falls away. The earth receives the petals and the seeds of spring lay in wait. Life is like that.  Breathing in, I receive the universe; breathing out, I release myself to the universe. Close attention to these processes reveals everything changes, yet everything is the same.<br /><br />Then again, sometimes cool air is just cool air.<br /><br />Be well.
