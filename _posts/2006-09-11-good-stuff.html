With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />On this lovely morning, I would like to talk about good things. What are good things? Things that nurture ourselves. Things that we do to nurture others. When you take a few moments to think about it, nurturance is the stuff of life.  As plants crave sunlight, water, and soil, so we crave  activity, nutritional sustanance, and most importantly,  love. In my own life, I am often reminded that I do the first two very well, easily actually, but the last one takes work. <br /><br />Why is it so challenging to love? In the abstract, love is easy.  We can say we 'love this' or we 'adore that,' but to actually love it?  This takes some work as well as courage.<br /><br />To love means to undress.  It means to let go of our armor and any other sorts of defenses as we allow another to enter our hearts.  For those of us injured by ones who cared for us, this can be exceedingly difficult.  We want to love, but are at the same time so wary of it. Love becomes an intimacy tango of sorts. We should all take a few minutes a day to offer something to someone else. In the offering, place your thoughts on the person. Open your heart to them. Its a good thing.<br /><br />Activity is something we all enjoy, well most of us.  Some (like myself, enjoy solo sports like running (big surprise)), others enjoy the team aspect of things. This does not have to be difficult, nor does it need to be a challenge. Ten minutes here and there through the day.  Who doesn't have ten minutes?  We each drive and park our cars. So, park far away from the entrance and "walk" to the store. Do walking meditation while slowly pushing the shopping cart at the grocery store.  Slowly and mindfully pick up and place items in your cart. Notice how your muscles move, how they operate. Good practice, this. I'm sure with your creative minds you will find other ways to move your bodies!<br /><br />Nutrition is always a challenge in the United States. Odd, such a wealthy country, yet so poorly fed. Choose a vegetable every day.  Choose a piece of fruit every day.  Limit your red meat, if you eat such a thing, and your dietary fat. Drink V-8 juice or tomato juice instead of that cup of coffee.  Replace a cup of coffee with a cup of green or white tea. Its all a matter of paying attention: being mindful in the everyday.<br /><br />Lastly and most importantly, practice zazen daily. Establishing a regular sitting time is important, as is making a place to sit.  This place should only be used for sitting, if possible. Create an alter for yourself.  You might place a photograph or a plant on this alter.  Traditionally, Buddhist alters have a candle, a small water offering, a statue of the Buddha, and incense burner, and a plant or flower. Again, be creative.  Offer yourself a space that is special to you.  A space that will nurture you. Then avail yourself of that space and time and just sit.<br /><br />Be well.<br /><br /><br />Team Zen: Yesterday; 3.85 mile run in the AM; 1 mile walk in the PM:  Today; 1 mile walk with pups AM, 1.1 mile run solo AM, chest, back, ab workout.
