<DIV>With palms together,</DIV>  <DIV>Good Morning All,</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Although the sun is already high in the sky, the desert air feels cool. There is a breeze off the mountains and a lovely&nbsp;scent comes with it.&nbsp;&nbsp; My early morning walk required a long sleeved shirt and my robe felt comfortable at zazen. All tell tale signs that&nbsp;we are approaching autumn.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Autumn is a wonderful time. The leaves begin their turn from green to yellow to brown. The dogs are a bit more eager to prance. The birds seem happier. Change is in the air. These are equinox seasons, spring and autumn. They are transitions. Like all periods of change, we can use them to reflect on the past, resist its passing,&nbsp;or look forward to the future, perhaps becoming impatient with the present. Yet, when we do, we miss each moment's particular brilliance.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Being present with change we see change is really an  illusion.&nbsp; Change only exists in our mind as a mental construction. Pictures of what was and compared to the present and yet again compared&nbsp;to what we want the picture to be. The truth is, the present is the only time that really exists for us. And so, what is here now is everything. </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Enjoy your universe.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Be well.&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT color=#ff0000><STRONG><EM>Team Zen: <FONT color=#000000>Early morning walk with pups and My Little Honey: 1 mile; Hillwork 4 x 1/10 mile (1/10 mile intervals) 1.15 miles: weight workout; &nbsp;arms, shoulders, abs .&nbsp;</FONT></EM></STRONG></FONT></DIV>  <DIV><STRONG><EM><FONT color=#ff0000></FONT></EM></STRONG>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><STRONG><EM><FONT color=#ff0000></FONT></EM></STRONG>&nbsp;</DIV><BR><BR><DIV><IMG src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/40.gif">Rev.
