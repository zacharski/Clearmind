<DIV>With palms together,</DIV>  <DIV>Good Morning All,</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>In our mind's eye, and sometimes if we are not careful, through our practice, we build elaborate, finely crafted necklaces of wisdom.&nbsp; Stunning and beautiful, they glitter in the light of our hearts and minds.&nbsp; Everyone sees our glitter, we ourselves are mesmerized by it. Isn't it wonderful to be so pretty and, well, soooo very special? </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Then a low rider pulls up next to us, blaring, thumping base notes pound, tatts and cigarette smoke, profanity, and a stare that chills us. The necklace breaks and all those pretty little jewels fall to the floor.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Our true practice is the practice of being present without any special mantel. Being present even when the present is hurtful, fearful, or smelly we are able to be our fear, our pain, or our offense. </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>So, what does this practice get us?&nbsp;  Nothing. Practice is not about attainment. Practice is about being and that is absolutely all it is about.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>So, practice zazen with care.&nbsp; Do not keep your zazen. Do not wear it around your neck as though it were a precious jewel. &nbsp;It is both nothing and everything at once, as are we ourselves.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Be well.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT color=#ff0000><STRONG><EM>Team Zen:</EM></STRONG></FONT></DIV><BR><BR><DIV><IMG src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/40.gif">Rev.
