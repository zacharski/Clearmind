With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />Our sesshin was a real success! This was the first sesshin we allowed attendance to be staggered. It was a little uncomfortable for those control freaks among us, me, to deal with but deal I did.<br /><br />We also had our Zen Center being re-roofed during the weekend. This meant sitting under tearing wood, pounding hammers, and the chatter of the workers (not to mention their footsteps overhead, as we sat silently through the weekend.<br /><br />The Sunday culmination of the retreat was beautiful as we each offered a piece of cake to the Hungry Ghosts, a symbolic gesture and commitment to those in need of our help, and honored those who have taken their next steps along the Zen Buddhist path.<br /><br />Ryan Weeks took the Three Refuges and became Zen To; Mike Mu Shin OMalley took the Precepts as his own, and Bonnie Busho Hobbs entered the priesthood as a Novitiate.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
