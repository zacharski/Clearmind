With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />Zen living is an everyday experience. It really does not matter what religion you follow, whether you believe in a God or not, or much of anything else. Zen living is living with an open eye and open heart. Zen living is living with a willingness to be still even when in motion. It is an attitude and a practice. It cam become a religion. It can become a philosophy. Yet in either case it is both and neither.<br /><br />If we commit to a meditation practice and meet our daily commitment, several things will happen., First you will develop a deep satisfaction over having committed to setting aside time to be with just yourself and your experience of yourself. Second, you Will learn a great deal from this time on the cushion. Third, you will develop the ability to remain present regardless of the experience.<br /><br />In the end, you learn what you already know. Your time with yourself on your cushion serves as a confirmation of this knowledge. Finally, you discover it is nothing special and yet extraordinary at the same time.<br /><br />I invite you each to establish a daily meditation practice. It does take a commitment. And a commitment requires something of us. It requires that the commitment must trump our feelings and thoughts. This is the discipline of the practice. For those coming to meditation as a way of feeling good, this is a huge stumbling block because it is those folks who are usually slave to their emotions and live undisciplined and chaotic lives as a result.<br /><br />I say to you, get a grip. The reins are yours to hold. Hold them.<br /><br />Be well.
