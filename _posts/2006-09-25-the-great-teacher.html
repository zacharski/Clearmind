With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />The desert air is cool. I am sitting by the living room window and feeling a chill from its touch on my shoulder through the open window. The feel of natural air, unconditioned by our machines, is a delight. The less we process things, it seems, the better they are.<br /><br />So too with zazen.<br /><br />When we sit down on our cushion. We should just sit down, back upright, shoulders open, and head erect. We feel the bones as they seem to organized themselves one on top of another while taking our seat. There is nothing special about this save the deliberate nature of being still. Nothing conditioned.  No machine involved. There is just zazen.<br /><br />We should not process this experience while in the experience.  Processing things takes us away from them and in fact, kills the moment.  Being witness with a student's eye is being there without a self. A student's eye is unencumbered by the dust of "things we know." <br /><br />Practicing this way is the great teacher.<br /><br />Be well.
