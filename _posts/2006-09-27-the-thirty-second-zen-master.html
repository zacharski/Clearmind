With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />Our practice is not talking practice, its not philosophy practice, its practice practice. Zazen is something we all would like to do. Many people want to meditate. Few do.<br /><br />Everything is a problem.  Not enough time.  Our back hurts.  Our legs hurt. Its too noisy.  There is nowhere in our homes that we feel comfortable.  Our spouses aren't supportive.  We have children, dogs, cats, jobs... you get the idea.<br /><br />All of these, however, are not problems.  They are real opportunities. Zazen is not outward, it is inward.  Zazen is about our attitude: right understanding.  When our understanding is correct, then everything becomes zazen.<br /><br />So, what is correct understanding?  When we are completely present with ourselves and our activity.  When the map, compass, body, and mind are in complete alignment, that is right understanding.  With this understanding every step is the correct step, naturally.<br /><br />We attain correct understanding, however through our practice of seated meditation and mindfulness.<br /><br />Therefore, it is important to find five minutes to be still.  Five minutes to place your attention on yourself and your environment as if you were simply there as a witness. Five minutes of serene reflection. If not five minutes, then one minute. If not one minute, then thirty seconds. Become a 30 second master!<br /><br />Its rather like prayer, you know,  No need for a fancy church or synagogue or mosque.  No need for a priest, minister, or rabbi. No need for an official time, public pronouncement, advertisement of any sort. Just do it.<br /><br />Be well.
