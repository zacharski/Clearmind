With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />In Memphis, we are enjoying Baby Tate immensely. He is nothing but cute, inquisitive energy stuffed into New Skin with eyes and fingers, mouth and feet.<br /><br />Our practice is being witness, guide, protector, clown, and nurturer.<br /><br />I've exchanged my morning zazen for a kindergarten of one.  We learn to make cereal bowls into bells, Cheerios into offerings, and dirty diapers, incense.<br /><br />This is the Way of Grandparents.<br /><br />Be well.
