With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />Yesterday during an interview with a student, I tried to teach something about walking in ones own authority. This is such a challenging notion. It does not mean being full of oneself. Nor does it mean being a dictator.  People who walk in their own authority are confident in themselves and as a result of that confidence have little real need for the signs and symbols of their authority.<br /><br />When we make ourselves in the world, we should do so simply and directly. The plan and the activity of building should be seamless, as if they were what they are: one.<br /><br />There is a spin on one of the Dharma seals, "shoho jisso", which means all things are themselves ultimate reality. This is another way of saying "it is what it is" and adding everything is truth.<br /><br />When I open my eyes and take my breath, I express my true nature. As I pour my coffee, put on my clothes, walk my dogs, I express my true nature.  No need to be anything, I am what I am. When we live this way we are living within our own authority.  And this is important because it is authentic.<br /><br />So many of us live in fear of the thoughts and judgments of both others and our inner self.  Our choices are the result of an internal dialogue rather than a direct expression of our being. So, what is it, after all, that we fear? Why the chatter? Why the wobble?<br /><br />If you are going to light that match, light it.  If you are going to strike that bell, strike it.  If you are disabled, be what you are.  No need to hide or get permission to come out.<br /><br />Our practice is simple, yet so challenging. To be upright on a cushion and live there directly in the moment. Once our mind thoroughly understands there is no threat, no problem. It releases its grip, lets go of the rudder and allows us to be what we are.<br /><br />Be well.<br /><br /><br /><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong><em>Team Zen: two mile run/walk ; a chest and back weight workout.</em></strong></span>
