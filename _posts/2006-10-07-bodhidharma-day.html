With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />Today we celebrate Bodhidharma Day in Las Cruces by being in mindful practice at Zen Center. Bodhidharma was a simple monk who came from India to China in the late fifth century. He taught simply, but consistently, that zazen was the core of the Buddha's teaching.  He was a pragmatic and experiential sort who lived in a cave and gazed at its wall. No fancy temples, no fancy clothes, just his body and a wall with a strong determinationed practice. We consider this man to be the First Zen Patriarch. All current Zen lineages call him parent.<br /><br />If you are nearby Zen Center today and would like to sit in stillness for awhile, please feel free to join us.<br /><br />Last night some friends gathered at a local ice cream stand:<br /><br /><div>Eating ice cream in the wind,</div><div>Chocolate drops on a field of blue; </div><div>The moon is bright in the sky.</div><br /><br />Be well.
