With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />Waking to rolling thunder and a wet breeze I am reminded of jungles and the scent of fear. Its odd how one thing recalls another, but I believe this is how our mind works; a sort of memory karmic action.<br /><br />Yesterday I had occasion to meet an elder writer.  At 98 she has come out with a memoir.  She is a delightful woman and sat gracefully in a chair signing her book. I sat next to her for awhile.  On my other shoulder was a man I had met elsewhere.  A Vietnam combat vet, like myself, who still cannot sleep and still is haunted by decades old demons.<br /><br />We talked.<br /><br />Both people had memories, both said they wished some of their memories would disappear, yet one uses her memories to contextualize her life; the other finds memory a felonious intrusion.<br /><br />As I sat between them, I remembered a return trip to Vietnam I took with my wife and some other Vietnam Vets some years ago.  I recalled sitting at a long table in a dining room in some humid northern province. One side, an array of American Vietnam veterans; the other side, an array of North Vietnamese Army veterans.  We traded shots, this time however, the shots were not metal, but rather cheap Russian vodka.<br /><br />We shared stories and photographs, we laughed and cried. Just a mess of sloppy human beings discovering our ability to forgive and embrace. I noticed as I told this story, my veteran friend withdrew and responded with a slight degree of fear.  I think it is this that so deeply separates us.<br /><br />Today I sat in a beautiful living room with a group of talented writers, eating petifiores and sipping punch. Almost odd, but so distinctly human.<br /><br />Fear is a clear hindrance in our mind.  If allowed, it drives us into caves of darkness wherein every shadow is a killer. Yet I know it is possible to be like a small candle. Still, and serene illuminating without blazing, teaching ourselves that the monsters we fear are only ourselves in darkness.<br /><br />Be well.
