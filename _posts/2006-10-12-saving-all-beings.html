<DIV>With palms together,</DIV>  <DIV>Good Morning All,</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>This morning was interesting. Most mornings are, you know.&nbsp; We are awakened by whatever, in my case a small dog with a wet tongue, and see that it is morning.&nbsp; We are grateful for awakening and opening our eyes to see clearly.&nbsp; We set out to save all sentient beings.&nbsp; OMG!&nbsp; What a task!</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Sentient being Numero Uno is myself.&nbsp; I drive down to the Zendo, light the alter candles, light incense.&nbsp; Make coffee for breakfast.&nbsp; I climb onto the Ino's cushion and wait.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>In comes Zen To, slapping feet on the saltio tile. He is respectful, bows and enters, stands by his seat. No other sentient beings arrive as my watch indicates its time: bell is invited to ring.&nbsp; Chanting happens. Wood blocks are rhythmically struck. Then abruptly, silence.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>At the appointed time,  the bell is invited to sound again.&nbsp; More chanting and drumming. Light an incense offering, bow, leave the zendo. </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Breakfast was simple.&nbsp; Zen To learned to make pancakes on the griddle.&nbsp; I poured the coffee.&nbsp; We ate and talked about Suzuki-roshi's first book.&nbsp; Just after breakfast two other sentient beings arrive, Revs. Hogaku and Shin Getsu roshi.&nbsp; They come with a new wooden shoji screen for our Zendo entrance. They bring cinnamon rolls.&nbsp; I eat one and think about getting fat.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Zen&nbsp;To leaves, I make arrangements to meet Rev. Gozen for lunch with the roshis.&nbsp;Three three of us who are left chat a bit about the Zen Center and saving all sentient beings, then I go home to My Little Honey.&nbsp; It is 9:00 AM. </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Time for a nap.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Be well.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT  color=#ff0000><STRONG><EM>Team Zen:</EM></STRONG></FONT></DIV><BR><BR><DIV><IMG src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/40.gif">Rev.
