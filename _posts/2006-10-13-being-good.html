With palms together,<br />Good Afternoon All,<br /><br />We live to be good people. Yet sometimes, I think we slip into just living, not even just living, but a sort of existing that includes going through the motions of eating, talking, working, sleeping, with no attention on what each moment of being is for us.<br /><br />How do we live to be good people? What is required of us?  Do we need to be superheroes?  Heroes? Do we need to be Great Buddhas? Jesus?  Moses?  The Prophet?<br /><br />When we walk along the sidewalk, we notice an ant and step over the ant. When we notice there is no toilet paper on the roll, we replace the toilet paper. If someone is angry with us, we listen. If someone needs us, we are there. These are nothing really special, nothing extraordinary, yet so often we are so asleep that we step on the ant, leave the bathroom, blow off someones feelings, and turn on the TV. Modern life has many exits.<br /><br />Being present has only one: zazen. Zazen is the practice of being present.  Attention to the world within us and without us: we are neither engaged nor disengaged. Whatever is there is there and we are with it 100%. Our body is upright; our mind is upright; our heart is open. Practice.<br /><br />Be well.
