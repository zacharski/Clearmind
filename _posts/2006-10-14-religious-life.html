With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />This morning I woke to a gentle rain. How nice to hear the tender sound of raindrops. My Little Honey is already out the door.  She and friend Deana are attending some yarn or knitting event.  They hope to sell buttons they have made. So, I am home alone on a Saturday morning. A day of rest.  No Zen Center. Just myself and the universe.  Well, there is Tripper, who tries to eat Pete-kitty, who will have none of it, and of course, Pepper who just watches all the fuss.<br /><br />I must say I do enjoy this stage of my life, enjoying such moments as this. Zazen has taught my body/mind to accept the moment without very much conflict. Conflicts that do arise, are settled quickly because they are there to be resolved. Arguments are less hostile, more pliable, and end quickly.<br /><br />This is being upright. A duck on water, choppy or still, is a duck on water.<br /><br />The rain is increasing its tempo. We have gone from waltz to four-step. Perhaps we will be witness to a tango. Its just rain. I sit under the canopy of my apartment, participant-witness to it all.<br /><br />This is religious life.<br /><br />Be well.
