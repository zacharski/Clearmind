With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />We have all heard the phrase, "no time like the present."  In Zen this is considered a daily mantra. Past and future are creations of mind. Yet we must be careful not to make the present moment a creation as well.<br /><br />We live in the present by living directly, mindfully, and without the craziness that comes with discrimination. Here in this moment, there are plastic keys.  Fingers. Electricity. Light. Yet, as soon as I name these, they are not it at all. Now they are my language applied to the phenomenon. What is light before we call it light?  What is plastic, finger? before the two meet?<br /><br />Who cares.<br /><br />When the light is on, appreciate it.  When it is time to write, write; time to clean, clean.  This is the "so what"  practice of Zen.<br /><br />Living in the past, we are dead.  Living in the future, not yet born.  The present is not a theory. It is what it is: appreciate it.<br /><br />Be well.
