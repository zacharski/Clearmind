<DIV>With palms together,</DIV>  <DIV>Good Morning All,</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>When we truly understand everything is relative to everything, then we see nothing is anything more or less than anything else.&nbsp; And when we stand on a single point, everything is relative to it. Where do we stand?</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>I prefer not to. But, unlike that fictional schrivener, Bartleby,&nbsp;I will&nbsp;be what is there to do. </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Its taken a long time to get to this place.&nbsp;I highly recommend it. The mountains are what they are; the rivers and, in my case, the desert, is what it is.&nbsp; And then it is not. Being comfortable with the flow of process is key to our survival and ability to see clearly. Those looking for solid ground, even for an instant are consumed by the rivers that run through them.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Be well.</DIV><BR><BR><DIV><IMG  src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/40.gif">Rev.
