With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br /><br />The first of the Three Pure Precepts is "Cease doing evil."  Not so simple in today's world.  What, after all, is evil?  Evil conjures up all sorts of things, the least of which is Halloween masks or Tales From the Crypt. Evil is something we too often see as very specific. War.  Violence. Cruelty. Evil has a face we believe and more, a face we are all apt to both see and agree upon.<br /><br />I'm not so sure. I suspect the true face of evil is much more subtle and difficult to see.<br /><br />Evil causes harm, it erodes life, kills, causes us to suffer. But, then, so does good. Choosing even in the affirmative always negates something. Perhaps it isn't the actual choice so much as choice itself? To choose one person over another for a transplant.  One country over another for our aid. One battle instead of another. Or not to fight at all.  So what is evil? That which causes harm? Everyday we cause harm.  Is it a matter of scale?  Or intent? Or consequence?<br /><br />Is it enough to be aware?  Enough to translate that awareness into some sort of action?<br /><br />I don't know.<br /><br />I think my questions are important, terribly important.  I think we do not think about them nearly enough and should talk about them often. We certainly don't pay much attention to them as we live out our daily lives.  But, on the other hand, that's why we practice zazen, isn't it?  To raise our level of awareness?  To get mind, body, and environment in sync and on the same page?<br /><br />I hope so.<br /><br />I really do.<br /><br />Be well.
