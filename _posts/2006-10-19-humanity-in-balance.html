With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />Last evening instead of zazen, I attended a screening of Al Gore's "An Inconvenient Truth."  Please do yourself a favor and click on the link below to this film's website.  Clearly we are facing some serious problems environmentally. No amount of partisan bickering or special interest crap will save us from what the earth itself will do to us if we do not become wiser.<br /><br />This was my second time through this film.  I was struck with Mr. Gore's humanity. I was taken once again with his ability to set out the facts, undeniable facts, regarding our climate change.  I was reminded, childishly I suppose, of the beginning scenes of Superman when Superman's father is trying to convince his government that there is an impending crisis.<br /><br />Then the thought struck me like a thunderclap: its futile. Mr. Gore named his first book, "Earth in the Balance."  I have a copy of it. But I think it is misstated.  More accurate would be, "Humanity in the Balance."  The earth isn't going anywhere and as the film powerfully points out, has its own natural ways of correcting things.We keep thinking in human terms.  The earth will have its way and regardless of how special we think we are, it will recover its balance and that it that.   The earth measures its time in millenia. A few hundred thousand years, waves and waves of change, and everything is back on track, sans humanity.<br /><br />So, maybe that Christian text, Revelations, is on target, perhaps we will end in flames, the flames of a global warming of our own making.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.climatecrisis.net/">http://www.climatecrisis.net/</a><br /><br />Be well.
