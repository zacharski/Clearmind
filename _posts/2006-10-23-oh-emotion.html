With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />When we are afraid and are willing to remain in the fear we can learn. It is the same with anger, joy and sadness. Our feelings can be understood as gates which open to our heart-mind. Care must be taken, but it is best if the gates remain open.<br /><br />When I am afraid, I tend to seek defenses. Of course, it's also a good idea to turn on the light!  And often, once the light is on, there is no longer anything there to fear.  So, fear is often about not-knowing. If I am afraid and do not turn on a light to look at what is there, I am likely to built a fortress around me with attitude, feelings, and words, that are enough to scare the bejezzus out of an elephant. Much simpler to turn on a light.  Simpler, but all too often, more challenging.<br /><br />What is it we are so afraid of? Our unwillingness to be vulnerable speaks volumes about us, doesn't it?  In the end, what will happen will happen...or already has...not-knowing and staying in a fortress in the dark will not help for long.<br /><br />Turning in the light means being willing to be still with yourself in the midst of whatever is happening around you or within you.  When we loose his stillness and succumb to the waves, we only need turn our attention to our breath and the experience of the moment, be it anger, fear, sadness, or joy. These feelings are not lethal, they are feelings, they will always fade away.<br /><br />Yet, as a group we are woefully inadequate at dealing with them when they are there.  Even our emotional vocabulary is poverty stricken.  And without a word, we cannot create a sense of mastery.  Its as if the parts are just 'out there' buffeting us about the head and shoulders.  We say we 'hate' this when we mean we don't like it.  We feel 'enraged' when we actually feel annoyed. We are emotional hyper boles.<br /><br />This tendency is very dangerous as feeling are the drivers of behavior.Too few of us learn how to push in the clutch. And we are off!<br /><br />Zazen is an excellent practice for learning about the clutch. I recommend it.<br /><br />Be well.<br /><a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/mail_us/taglines/postman8/*http://us.rd.yahoo.com/evt=39663/*http://voice.yahoo.com"><br /></a>
