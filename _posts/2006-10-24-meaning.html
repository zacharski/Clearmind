With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br /><br />Meaning<br /><br />Waking this morning<br />to a gentle rain against the window<br />The sound was nourishing.<br /><br />Inside, under the cover of the patchwork quilt my wife made,<br />safe and cozy,<br />able to perceive the sound of the rain.<br /><br />Outside, a different matter altogether. <br />No safety, no warmth. <br />Just cold wet water.<br /><br />The rain is the same.<br /><br />Be well.<br /><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong><em></em></strong></span>
