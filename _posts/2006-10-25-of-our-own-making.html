With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />Of Our Own Making<br /><br /><em>When the sky is so beautiful</em><br /><em>I fail to see the gentle grass.</em><br /><br />Big Mind is so seductive.<br />I want to smack it.<br /><br /><em>That grass is home to snakes,</em><br /><em>Yet it frames the sky.</em><br /><br /><div>Little Mind is so ordinary. </div><div>I want to puff it up. </div><br /><br /><em>Every picture needs a frame,</em><br /><em>Every frame, a picture.</em><br /><br />I am a metronome:<br />both artist and audience.<br /><br />___<br /><br />Be well.
