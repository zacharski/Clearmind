With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br /><br />The challenge of serene reflection meditation is rather steep. On the surface it appears very easy, just sit still for awhile. Yet, when we make the choice to stop our movement, things seem to happen: an old pain surfaces, an itch develops, an awful thought arises...or a very pleasant one. So just sitting there itself becomes a serious obstacle to what we want, namely, to move.<br /><br />I recommend not moving.<br /><br />Serene reflection meditation is not relaxation, nor is it a means of finding bliss.  It is not therapeutic and it is not easy. It is hard work requiring your constant attention.<br /><br />Life is like that.<br /><br />When we practice living we tend to think of it as easy.  Oh, if I were twenty one, no problem!  If only I had a better job!  Or a college degree!  Or a beautiful spouse!  Or that nice new car being advertised!  Life would be perfect. Then we get these things.<br /><br />Yes, life is like that. <br /><br />It requires our constant attention. <br /><br />Be well.
