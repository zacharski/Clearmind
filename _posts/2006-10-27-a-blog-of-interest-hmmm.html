With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />My Yahoo360 Blog is being featured this month by Yahoo as one of their interesting blogs.  Goodness, my mailbox was very full with comments, requests for connection, and congratulations. I am practicing several of those pesky paramitas just now.<br /><br />The air has definitely taken a turn for the colder side of things. It feels good. I laundered my sweatshirts and have located my sweaters.  In the desert southwest we need little more than than. My robes are warm and I enjoy them in the Zendo.<br /><br />A shaved head does require a hat.  I prefer those knitted sock thingies, sort of like a mitten for the brain. My Little Honey often thinks I look ridiculous. I think I'm cool...well, warm, actually.<br /><br />Be well.
