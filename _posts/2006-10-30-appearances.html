With palms together,<br />Good Evening All,<br /><br />Please accept my apologies for such a late message.  Today was a very nice day. The sun was bright and the sky, clear. The air was crisp in the morning; warmed in the afternoon, and chilled again this evening.  I now sit in my zendo with my pups sleeping nearby.  The incense is burning and my small candle is lit. Shortly I will sit down on my zafu and begin my practice.<br /><br />A reader, Jeff, posted a note on one of my blogs.  He cited two postings that seemed to contradict each other:<br /><br /><em>"If you need to believe in something go somewhere else. Zen is not about belief, if fact it is anti-belief." - posted by So Daiho Hilbert on Oct 29 2006<br /><br />"As a religious or philosophical person, we must take our belief, faith, our practices, if they are authentic, out into the world. We must stand for the good against evil. Good and evil are not amorphous concepts. They are practical and political realities.- posted by So Daiho Hilbert on Jun 30 2006<br /></em><br />I am deeply flattered by this posting as it clearly suggests Jeff is a serious student who is paying attention to my blatherings. As in all things, Zen or otherwise, two sides of any coin never touch but are deeply connected.  I say on one hand, belief is an obstacle, and on the other hand suggest people of principle are believers.  I believe wholeheartedly that both are true.<br /><br /><div>A believer has no need of a light, believing he already possesses the truth. Yet, in truth, only when we turn the light of day toward something does the thing itself become clear.</div><br /><br />We must have faith in our practice, in what he Buddha has taught us, and our experience confirms, and <em>at the same time</em>, remain skeptical not only other people's views, but of our senses and our perceptions, as well. When we look deeply into our own nature and see what is there, there is nothing to fear and nothing to stand against. As Uchiyama-roshi says, we must "open the hand of thought," to which I add, all of life unfolds.<br /><br />Be well.
