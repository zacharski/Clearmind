With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />Zazen was good this morning.  It is always good to sit still and become yourself. Someone wrote to me and asked what to do in the "sadness phase" of meditation.  I am uncertain as to what she meant, but I suspect when she is quiet, sadness emerges from the shadows.<br /><br />One of the most challenging aspects of zazen is just this. When we sit quietly in stillness, all of our typical distractions are taken away from us.  Movement, chewing gum, smoking, drinking, eating, talking, everything is just gone. These things provide cover for the other things that haunt us. So when they are not there, no cover, and bam! There they are, those pesky feelings or thoughts or memories. And we are there to witness them.<br /><br />OK. So, what's the problem?  They are just thoughts, just feelings, just memories. They have no power of their own. They are chimera. It is when we take them and build on them and wish they weren't there or were there more often or whatever that we begin to go crazy. <br /><br />Zazen is simply about experience. We do not judge the experience.  We do not move from it or to it.  We just experience. We learn from this experience over time that everything has a life of its own so to speak.  Things rise and things fall, just as our breath comes and goes. When we are with the coming and going, no problem; when we resist it, big problem.<br /><br />As for me, I am just a simple person on a cushion who enjoys being still. Then again, maybe not.<br /><br /><br />Be well.
