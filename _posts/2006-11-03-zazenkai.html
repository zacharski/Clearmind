<DIV>With palms together,</DIV>  <DIV>Good Morning All,</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Tomorrow we will practice zazen throughout the day.&nbsp; It is Zazenkai day at Zen Center.&nbsp; I look forward to this opportunity to practice with you.&nbsp; If you are not within distance of Zen Center or are otherwise occupied with matters of consequence, please practice mindfulness through your day.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Each day the sun comes up, we are offered the opportunity to become a buddha. Yet these days are numbered.&nbsp; It is up to you not to waste your time. </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>This means in each act, each breath, of each moment, we are to make ourselves aware of each act, each breath, and each moment.&nbsp; This is attention.&nbsp; It requires practice. When we practice all things change, they come alive.&nbsp; The colors are brighter, the textures are more vibrant, because our senses are keener. We use our attention to open ourselves to the  universe. </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>This is a very good thing.&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT color=#ff0000><STRONG><EM>Team Zen:</EM></STRONG></FONT></DIV><BR><BR><DIV><IMG src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/40.gif">Rev.
