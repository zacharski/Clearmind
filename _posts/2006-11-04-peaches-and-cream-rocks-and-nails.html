With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />Today is a good day to spend in meditation. Or in mindfulness. As my finger touches each key, I am aware that each finger is touching a key. I am aware of the muscle movement in my forearm as my fingers extend and contract, aware of the thoughts arising and falling, being recorded on the electronic page of this computer soon to be presented to you.<br /><br />When we are mindful, we are aware of the things themselves, but also aware that these things come and go.  On the one hand we say they are ours, like "my thoughts" but on the other, we notice that thoughts simply are thoughts and they arise and they fall away.  A notion of ownership, in a sense, becomes meaningless. In another sense they are quite meaningful, as they originate from our brain, and our brain originates from its connections with all of the other subsystems created by our genetics, even these are connected and originate through interactions with other systems.  When we are mindful we are aware that when we eat, we eat ourselves. We we touch our partners or a stranger, we touch ourselves. And so we do so with care.<br /><br />This is a difficult practice and though I try, I often fail at achieving it. The world seems to exist outside of us and can easily crash in bursting this little Buddha Bubble I've just created.  Or has it? You know, stress is just another feeling. Loss, love, anger, just feelings. They roll toward us like ocean waves.  sometimes we resist them, sometimes we embrace them, sometimes we just let go and go with their flow.<br /><br />Where is it written that everything should be peaches and cream and that we should be as smooth as the cream flowing over the peaches? Aware of the peaches, I am also aware of the rocks and the nails, and the sting of angry, hurtful words.<br /><br />Our practice is to take this awareness and use it.<br /><br />Be well.
