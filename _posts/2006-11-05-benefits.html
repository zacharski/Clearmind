With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />It is a wonderful thing to be offered the opportunity to practice zazen. In this practice we are able to clarify the mind, experience directly, and behave with autheniticity.  All from the simple practice of stilling oneself on a cushion facing a wall.<br /><br />Yesterday's zazenkai at Zen Center was just such an experience.  We had nerly a full house in the morning and, although some had to leave after oryoki lunch, others arrived. We practiced in silence and had a hour's samu to clean the Zen Center as meditative release from the cushion.<br /><br />Today I return to Zen Center for our morning service.  I return with fresh eyes and a real sense of deep appreciation for Sangha and this practice.<br /><br />Please join me.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
