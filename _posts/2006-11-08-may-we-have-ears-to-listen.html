<DIV>With palms together,</DIV>  <DIV>Good Morning All,</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Yesterday, three of my friends worked the polls. My Little Honey and I did this for a couple of years in Mayhill, near our Refuge. It is a long day, believe me, but so rewarding.&nbsp; I want to take a moment and thank Eve, Allen, and Lou for their volunteerism. You each are a blessing to our community.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>As the day passed into night, I watched the election off and on. It is an amazing thing this democratic process. The "fair and balanced" conservative news&nbsp;network could not seem to get a handle on the immensity of the tidal wave for change, and the original 24 hour news&nbsp;network could barely control itself.&nbsp;Clearly the people of the United states have sent a message in no uncertain terms to our President. </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Let us hope he has ears to listen.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Appropos to this I read that new text on  the&nbsp;Buddha and the Terrorist&nbsp;yesterday. We could learn much from this story. A terrorist and mass murderer from a low caste meets the Buddha, is pacified, becomes enlightened, and is forgiven. The terrorist goes on to become a monk and instrument of compassion.&nbsp; This story is testimony to the power of compassion and skillful means. I highly recommend this book to you.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><A href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/images/1565125207/ref=dp_image_0/103-0201848-2387047?ie=UTF8&amp;n=283155&amp;s=books">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/images/1565125207/ref=dp_image_0/103-0201848-2387047?ie=UTF8&amp;n=283155&amp;s=books</A></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Be well.</DIV><BR><BR><DIV><IMG src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/40.gif">Rev.
