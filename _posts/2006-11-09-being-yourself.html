With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />There is a wonderful sun in the sky already here in New Mexico. The sky is clear and it is a nice 66 degrees F. I just returned from morning Zazen.  We had a nice turnout for morning and I made us all pancakes and eggs with coffee. It was really nice sitting at the table together. <br /><br />We talked about the precepts this morning and I tried to stress that the precepts are not rules. Rules are external, they are brittle, they are decidedly unBuddhist. The Buddha taught that we are all already completely enlightened beings, meaning that the precepts are actually fluid doorways to a true expression of our buddhanature. When we drop away the clutter and see directly with a clear mind, there is no separation between us and the precepts.  We are the precepts.<br /><br />Today, please be the buddha you are.<br /><br />Be well.
