With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />There are some sounds that are very comforting.  The sound I hear right now is Pepper's breath as he sleeps by my feet. The sound yesterday was the laughter of good friends enjoying a serendipitous meal together. Sounds are a true picture of the nature of things, We cannot hold onto them. And memory is pale in comparison. Yet there they are in our experience. Direct, they lift us up, yet leave us just instantly.<br /><br />All of the senses are like this.<br /><br />We suffer when we try to keep them close. We suffer when we value one over another.<br /><br />So, regardless of the sound, hear it; regardless of the sight, see it. Appreciate the moment.<br /><br />Be well.
