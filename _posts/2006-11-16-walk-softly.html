With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />My apologies for missing yesterday.  I am just a little overwhelmed with Yahoo 360, Zen Center, and buying a new house. Our apartment complex, a beautiful gated community, has been sold and is being converted into condominiums.  We have the choice of buying or moving at the end of our lease.  So we have been looking about for a house and weighing the pros and cons of purchasing the unit we are in.<br /><br />Yahoo 360 has been a real ride, as they say.  I get a ton of messages, requested to be friends, and the odd assortment of very strange messages like "What kind of crack did you smoke as a kid!" Hmmm. What I am impressed with is the sincere nature of most of the comments and questions.  The heartfelt requests for assistance in dealing with life's issues.  I have been deeply humbled by these.<br /><br />So, lately, I am spending much time quietly trying to address the suffering, the questions, and the odd thoughts that this Internet experience seems to be evoking. Our world clearly is getting immediate and intimate. Quick IM conversations with Chinese, Iraqis, Iranians, Thais, Japanese...longer conversations with Westerners seeking some sort of assistance with the challenges of their practice, and the occasional solicitation for romance has kept me quite busy. I am grateful for this opportunity to be of service. <br /><br />In the end, I am reminded just how similar we all are.  Each of us, regardless of country or spiritual path seems to be seeking similar things.  We seek happiness.  We seek peace.  We seek a sense of safety and security.  And we seek prosperity. This is common ground. May we each walk upon it softly.<br /><br />Be well.
