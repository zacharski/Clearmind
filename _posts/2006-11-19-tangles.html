With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br /><em>"Not the faults of others, nor what others have done or left undone, but one's own deeds, done and left undone, should one consider."</em> <em>the Buddha</em><br /><br />The truth is so hard to take sometimes.  We live in a world where it seems we are always judging.  Well, I should really speak for myself.  I live in a world where I seem to always be judging.  In this world is pain and suffering and I realize I am its cause.<br /><br />If I were t place my sole attention on being the person I know I am, no problem. If I were to look at others as myself, no problem...well, maybe big problem, since I can be pretty hard on myself. But you get the point.<br /><br />It is so important to take care of one's own business, it is a first step to being upright. Yet so much easier to look somewhere else and pay attention to others. <br /><br />When we sit zazen we are left with only ourselves. Just us with our breath and our mind and our senses. Yikes!  Still, if we have the courage to continue to sit there, we begin to see clearly the work that needs to be done.  The ball of yarn begins to unravel of its own accord and there we are, free of the tangles of delusion.<br /><br />So, we get up off the cushion and do what is there for us to do. All the while letting others do the same.<br /><br />Be well.
