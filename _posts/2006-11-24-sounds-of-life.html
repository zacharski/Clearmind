With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />Well, we are in Memphis and have filled ourselves with either Turkey or Tofu Turkey depending...and lots of pumpkin pie with tons of whipped cream and cranberry sauce and mashed potatoes: so predictable, yet so delicious.<br /><br />It is good to be with family, though I wish all of us could be together. In a very real sense, though, we are. With every breath we take we are human beings alive in a world we deeply share with each other. Our thankfulness should not end with yesterday's sundown, but should spread out throughout the universe with our every action.<br /><br />So, today we take a walk, smell the cool autumn air, and feel each step with very excited baby sounds piercing our ears.<br /><br />Be well.
