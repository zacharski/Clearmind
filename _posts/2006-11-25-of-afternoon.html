With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />This morning was a wonder.  Tate woke with a serious hunger!  Screeching until he had breakfast.  The Zoo was too much for him, I guess, and he went to sleep last night hard and fast. At the Zoo earlier in the day, I had walked enough and sat down near the Pandas to finish reading a book I thoughtfully tucked in my shirt. <br /><br />It was a wonderful experience to sit and witness the families, the excitement of the children, and the sounds of wildlife. Pema Chodron's book on peace in times of war is a very good effort at teaching us to be present in the face of danger. I closed it and sat on the forward edge of my seat outside under some trees.<br /><br />A man noticed me sitting there and asked if I were meditating.  I smiled and said, "I am."  He replied that he was "Chillin'" as well, as he sorted the chairs and otherwise cleaned the area. He was Black and a hard worker; I am White and hardly work at all. He had a heavy gold cross around his neck, I had a string of 108 beads running through my fingers. He was Zen in motion, I was Zen in stillness, we both shared the moment together.<br /><br />Life is like that.<br /><br />Be well.
