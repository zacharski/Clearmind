With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />When we practice zazen, we are just present with ourselves. Self encounters self.  Sometimes we argue with each other, sometimes we run from each other, sometimes we watch movies of one, none of this is zazen. But every time we notice that we are doing these things and bring ourselves back to the present moment, we are practicing zazen. Zazen is in the noticing. It is the being, not the becoming.<br /><br />When we encounter something and act like a human being we ask questions, sometimes out loud and directly, but more often secretly and to ourselves.  What's this?  Who is this?  Where is this?  Why is this? And we put these things into a time-line of 'when is this?'  All perfectly natural. But all in the mind.  Each of these questions take us far away from the experience of the thing we are encountering.<br /><br />We answer our questions and believe we know something about the thing when in fact we know something about our thoughts about the thing. And there is a dramatic difference. This is why we can say it is a mistake to say, incense becomes ash.<br /><br />So, the next time you experience something new. Stop at the point of experience.  Keep the experience and let the thoughts about it go. This is zazen.<br /><br />Be well.
