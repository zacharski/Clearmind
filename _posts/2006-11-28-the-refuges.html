With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />There were two of us at Zen Center this morning. Michelle and I sat a solid period of zazen, I made pancakes, we ate, then sipped a morning cup of coffee and talked about the Three Refuges.  These are the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha.<br /><br />It might surprise you to know these are not always what you think they are.  The Buddha is not the person of the Buddha, nor the statue of the Buddha, nor an idea of the Buddha.  The Buddha is just being awake. Seeing without distortion, like a mountain in crisp morning air.  So, we take refuge is being awake.  The Dharma is the teaching, but not really.  The Teaching is not the Dharma.  Once uttered it is stale.  The Dharma is reality just as it is, unvarnished, sweet or stinky, smacking us upside our head. When we see clearly, with open eyes, no preconception, and experience this, this is Dharma.  It is the truth of our lives. Sangha is the world that supports us and our practice.<br /><br />So, forget stone Buddhas, fancy scriptures, and pretty temples. These are not our home. Our home is in our breath just now. Now. Now. Now.<br /><br />Buddhas and sutras and priests can be hindrances if we see them as something to emulate. These are just pictures of the thing.  Be the thing itself. How?<br /><br />Right now, let your eyes close half way, release your breath, and be present.<br /><br />How hard is that?<br /><br />Be well.
