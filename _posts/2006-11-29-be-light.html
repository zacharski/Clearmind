With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />A friend writes that I rarely quote sutras in my messages. He also points out that I rarely reply to comments. There is truth is this sorta. If we understand sutras as scripture, he is correct.  Scripture is what it is, a finger pointing to something.  The danger of scripture study is that we can get to a point where we value the scripture more than what it is pointing to. And what exactly is that?  Every scripture is about practice, that is to say, some aspect of living out an awakened life. <br /><br />Sutra study aids us.  It is a corrective lesson.  It helps us sit upright, so to speak, but it is not the sitting itself.  Sitting we must do. Life must be lived and when lived with open eyes the buddha is realized.<br /><br />Often my morning messages are replies.  Your messages suggest topics.  I clarify - or attempt to clarify - with my messages.  I write two of these a day. One I post to you on these lists and the other to my blog at Yahoo 360. I try to keep up with the direct correspondence as much as possible, yet life must be lived.  Puppies need to be walked, Zen Center needs to be taken care of, and Little Honeys listened to and engaged with.  Life is like that. <br /><br />The lessons of life are our own.  They are right there in the lives we live. We only need turn the lamp on them to realize them, as the Buddha himself said in his parinirvana sutra. I will leave you this morning with that: be a light unto yourself.<br /><br />Be well.
