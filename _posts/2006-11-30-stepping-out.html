With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />This morning my wrist alarm surprised me. I pushed back the down comforter and was greeted with a chill in the air. We have two alternatives, pull the comforters back up or throw them off and Step out into the cool morning air. Our lives, every moment of our lives, is just like that.<br /><br />We can pull the covers over us and stay warm and comfortable in what we know or we can cast off what we know and enter life with open eyes.<br /><br />This choice comes to us a million times a day.  It is the choice between being automatic and genuine. The choice between patience and impatient, generous or greedy, wise or shallow. The "right" choice is always both the more challenging and the more rewarding.<br /><br />Yet we should not make this choice on that basis.  Rather, we chose because we are buddhas being buddhas.<br /><br />Be well.
