<DIV>  <DIV>With palms together,</DIV>  <DIV>Good Morning All,</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Our Rohatsu sesshin was a powerful one. We were completely full and on Sunday, had several people sitting in the kitchen and two in the foyer of the Zen Center.&nbsp; Soon we will need a larger building, I suppose. </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>A deep bow of gratitude to each of you in attendance!</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>We all sat zazen very well. I must say, though, that our silence was broken late Saturday afternoon when one of the participants,Jeremy, requested the kyosaku and as I went to smack his shoulder I missed, hitting his neck!&nbsp; As I bowed and apologized, the whole Sangha erupted in laughter...this is what sitting hour after hour will do to you!</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Sesshin should not be tense. Neither should zazen.&nbsp; Neither should life.&nbsp; These are experience.&nbsp; Experience itself is neutral.&nbsp; It is what it is. We add to it our  various spins.&nbsp; We like this, we dislike that.&nbsp; People should be this way, not that way.&nbsp; And so on. It is this discerning mind that takes us away from Buddha Mind.&nbsp; </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Buddha Mind appreciates life as it is: sweet, sour, salty, torrid. Each of these is a pointer, so to speak.&nbsp; Appreciate and use the pointer, but then move on. So, while we can laugh at the Roshi's mistake, we should not carry it with us. I need to be completely mindful and present&nbsp;with my kyosaku and not assume I know how to use it well. &nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>What do you need?</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Be well.</DIV></DIV>
