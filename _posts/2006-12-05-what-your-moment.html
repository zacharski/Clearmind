With palms together,<br /><div>Good Morning All,</div><div> </div><div>This morning is different.  I was up late last night and fell asleep in the Zendo. My Little Honey slept in the bedroom.  My dogs slept in the Zendo with me, as did Pete-kitty.  So this morning My Little Honey crawled onto the futon and found a place amid all the little heart beats. Of course, Tripper was very unhappy that he had a rival for my attention. Rather than unfolding, this folded into an awakening experience for me: all hair and wet tongues and heartbeats.</div><div> </div><div>So, I got up and made the coffee, decided I had enough enlightenment and sat down in the living room to clear my head of the fur and hair that can be my life.</div><div> </div><div>Since the coffee is made, My Little Honey has decided she should join me, and all the other heartbeats followed.  It is said that wherever we go, there we are. </div><div> </div><div>Life is like that.  </div><div>No escape.</div><div> </div><div>So, what can we do?  We enjoy the moment by shifting gears, as is said today.  We let go of our expectations and enjoy the ride as it is. When we consciously do this it is possible to be taught. Drivers never learn, they are too busy driving. </div><div> </div><div>You might say, but how do we ever get anywhere?  And I answer, where is there to get? When we achieve something we want something else.  We we have something, it gets old and we want something new. When we have some money, we want some more. When there is always somewhere to go, we never arrive.</div><div> </div><div>Yet, to live in the moment does not mean there is no tomorrow or that we cannot plan for, and build toward, a future.  It means that in each moment, even if it is a planning moment, we experience it as fully and as completely as possible.  To do this requires something of us. </div><div> </div><div>We have to disappear and allow the present to be us.</div><div> </div><div>Be well.</div>
