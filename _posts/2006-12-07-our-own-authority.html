With palms together,<br /><div>Good Morning All,</div><div> </div><div>Someone wrote to ask me to speak more on the notion of walking in one's own authority. Since today is December 7th, the day Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, perhaps this is a good day for such a comment.  Brian Victoria wrote a book entitled Zen at War and in it he reveals the behavior of Japanese Zen monks during World War II.  Apparently, many were fervent nationalists, anti-Semites, and other such very un-Buddhist things. The question arises, then, how could this be?</div><div> </div><div>First, a monk's vows do not exempt a monk from his or her civic obligations.  We should all be good citizens. The question is, what does that mean?  My sense is that a good citizen is a buddha.  This means a person whose eyes are wide open, who lives in non-dualist terms and can easily move in the relative and absolutes that make our universe.  </div><div> </div><div>Walking in one's own authority requires inside information, so to speak. This inside information is a realization of our true nature, our original face, if you will: that face "we" had before "our" parents were born. Such information is always with us, it is a part of us, but we must find it ourselves through our practice.</div><div> </div><div>We could call this face God, if you will, or Buddha Mind, or the Universal, or simply Vast Emptiness. It really doesn't matter what it is called, what matters is that it is both experienced and actualized by us in our lives.  When this happens, the precepts become our own manifestations of this realization so that when we are in particular social situations, we know what to do and this doing is our own, as well. Yet, it corresponds precisely and exactly to Buddha Dharma.</div><div> </div><div>This is outside meeting inside and vice-verse: resolving both.</div><div> </div><div>So, when a monk is asked to do something which goes against his or her Buddha nature, he or she must find a skillful way of engaging the request to turn it into a teaching lesson for the universe.  This is what it means to "save all beings."  The lessons can be myriad. </div><div>This said, it is possible, probable even, that religious institutions become corrupt and power-hungry.  In Zen, this is also the case.  Monks argue over status and Temple politics, shuffling for this advantage or that: the same as any work environment. They can also become servants of the civil government and the mob majority.   However, it should not be. If we work the program as is said in other paths, then "letting go of self" and humility are the greatest teachers.  So there's the rub, when letting go of self, where does our authority go?</div><div> </div><div>A buddha understands that our authority is never ours, but is an aspect of our True Nature.  One who has realized this True Nature manifests it; one who has not, who only aspires to do so, does not.  Seeking this authority in a religious structure will never do.  In fact, the religious structure becomes a serious hindrance to achieving Clear Mind.</div><div> </div><div>Monks who do bad things are not walking in their own authority and this is their mot serious sin. </div><div> </div><div>Be well.</div>
