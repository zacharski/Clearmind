With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />Yes, the earth has clearly tilted.  Cooler temps, snow in places, and a cloudy sky this morning.  We hustle just a little more in the morning and wrap ourselves with layers of clothing.  I try not to give in so much to this temptation. Cold can be refreshing. Just as heat can be soothing. Yet, too much of either and we are in trouble.<br /><br />Today we should recognize the Buddha's achievement. He worked so hard for so many years only to discover in an instant that what he sought he already possessed, as do all of us. The most profound teaching, I suspect, is to stop seeking. This stopping, this deep abiding in silence with self allows for our release of self, paradoxically, and the concomitant discovery that there is no abiding self.<br /><br />Let us each witness the morning star in the same way.<br /><br />Be well.
