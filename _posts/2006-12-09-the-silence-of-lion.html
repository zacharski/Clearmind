With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />The day is unfolding slowly, as Saturdays do. There are clouds in the sky and the air is cool.  I am parked under a down comforter with Tripper at my side. My Little Honey is talking to our daughter and getting ready to leave for Knitters Guild.  I will be alone with the furboys for the morning.<br /><br />Whatever will I do?<br /><br />Setting aside the obvious dog walking, breakfast eating, meditation, and writing, nothing special.  This is as it should be. Life lived as one page to the next where our focus is on the page we are reading is best. Other pages are what they are and will turn as they may, but this very page is us.<br /><br />Pete-kitty sits<br />like a small lion<br />staring at my fingers<br />as they press these keys.<br />Silence unfolds.<br /><br />Be well.
