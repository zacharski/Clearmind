With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />As we awaken we say, "This morning I vow with all beings to see the world clearly as it is and to end violence and bring compassion to all beings."  In the evening we say, "This evening, as I go to sleep, may all beings rest and be renewed through peace and love."<br /><br />In this way we open and close our day by placing our attention on our true purpose in life, to nurture and support all beings. It is not that we are instruments of these things, rather, we are these things. Being the instrument of something creates a separation between the thing and the tool, as if they were not exactly the same. Being an instrument of compassion is not the same as being compassion.<br /><br />We each have work to do through each day for the rest of our lives. The paycheck of this work is immediate. When we open our eyes, there it is. Both work and reward are the exact same thing: a manifestation of our true nature.<br /><br />Be well.<br /><br /><em>As zero and one do their dance, infinity happens.</em>
