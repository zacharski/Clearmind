<div align="right"><em>for Joshua</em></div><em></em><br /><em></em><br />With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />In Zen we practice to see our True Nature.  Be careful! <br /><br />Our True Nature<br />is the Universe<br />and the Universe<br />has nothing<br />to stand upon.<br /><br />So, what happens when we confront our Self?  See our impermanence, our absolute emptiness? Maybe we say "Eureka!"  I think not.<br /><br />Most ordinary human beings, those Dogen calls mortals, require something to stand on.  they require a reference point, something to define themselves against: like form and space in a painting. But with our True Nature, we see these are ever in motion, nothing substantial, everything like the clouds in the sky.<br /><br />Seeing our True Nature, we step into the world of the Buddhas: immortal where each breath is a manifest opportunity, each touch, the creation of kindness and compassion, each step a walk into infinity.<br /><br />Be well.<br /><br /><br /><em>Kindness requires patience. Patience requires generosity. Open your heart to yourself and embrace the universe.</em>
