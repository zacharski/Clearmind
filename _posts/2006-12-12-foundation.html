With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />Those here seeking wisdom and knowledge are welcome, however, it is important to orient yourself to how this process is understood in Zen Buddhism.  Wisdom and knowledge are often thought to be something that exist outside of us, that can be imparted by one person to another.  That is a dualistic notion and is incorrect.<br /><br />Wisdom and knowledge are innate: we all possess them. We practice to see what is already there within us and before us.  We practice to eliminate the proscenium that separates the actor from the universe.<br /><br />So, if you are seeking something from me or others, stop. Seek it from yourself.  How?  Create a time each day to practice zazen.  Practicing zazen regularly is a gate to understanding and realization. Let nothing get in the way of this regular practice.  It becomes your spiritual foundation, literally.<br /><br />Then post your experience. Posting is a process of self examination and awareness. I ask replies be explorations rather than fingers pointing to supposed errors.<br /><br />Best wishes,<br /><br />Be well.
