<DIV>With palms together,</DIV>  <DIV>Good Morning All,</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>  <DIV>One way that Zen differentiates itself from other religions, even from Buddhism itself, is on the issue of belief. Zen Buddhists are nothing if not iconoclastic. (An iconoclast is a breaker of icons).&nbsp; There is a famous saying, "If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him!"&nbsp; While this should not be taken literally, it should be held closely. </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Buddhas, images of Buddhas, stories of Buddhas, miracles of Buddhas are all fictions. We create these images and stories, and then use them as yardsticks against which we measure ourselves.&nbsp; This is wrong-headed.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>When we break the images, burn the stories, and tear up the scriptures, we are on our own and must confront ourselves.&nbsp; This is the heart of Buddhist practice and it is not for everyone. </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>We sit facing a wall.&nbsp; Our  bodies upright, our eyes open, our attention on everything present.&nbsp; No belief.&nbsp; No doctrine. No dogma. Just this.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>So, this morning at the Zendo, I lit a stick of incense, bowed and sat down on my cushion.&nbsp; Facing the wall, I met myself.&nbsp; Facing myself, I let myself fall away. What is left?</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Buddha.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Be well.</DIV></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><BR><BR><DIV><IMG src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/40.gif">Rev.
