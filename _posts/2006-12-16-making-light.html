<DIV>  <DIV>With palms together,</DIV>  <DIV>Good Morning All,</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Last night was so delightful.&nbsp; We went to the synagogue for Friday evening services which was a children's service and Hanukkah candle lighting.&nbsp; We had a dozen or so menorahs on a table and before we ate the children recited the blessings over and over as they themselves lit the first night's candles.&nbsp; Such traditions are as &nbsp;important as they are beautiful. </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>This season is a time of light.&nbsp; Menorahs, Christmas trees,&nbsp; and in the Buddhist tradition, the light of the Buddha's Enlightenment itself. &nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>To bring light into the world is an act of creation.&nbsp; It is not hope, faith, or charity.&nbsp; It is the thing itself.&nbsp; It is dark, we make light. We light a candle, we turn a switch, we dress a tree, but as human beings we make light by cracking out of our shells and unfolding  ourselves to the universe.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>From a Zen Buddhist perspective, light and dark are literally of our own creation.&nbsp; We do good or we do bad, and these things are judged more from our intent than from the outcome. If you are a theist, and you must have a God in your lives, you can easily understand this as God working through you. You and God are partners in creation: you are His hands, His eyes, His fingers, but you are also His mind...<EM>and He is yours</EM>.&nbsp; In Zen, we see this as "Big Mind."&nbsp; This is the open expanse of time and space, light and dark, the breath before the breath, of life and death. &nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Now, go make light.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Be well.</DIV></DIV><BR><BR><DIV><IMG src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/40.gif">Rev.
