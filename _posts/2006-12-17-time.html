<DIV>With palms together,</DIV>  <DIV>  <DIV>Good Morning All,</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>My goodness here it is Sunday once more.&nbsp; Have you noticed how time is so relative to age? When we are young and imagine all the benefits of being older, we so look forward to the passing of time that it slows.&nbsp; And as aging people, we are <EM>not</EM> so looking forward to the end of days&nbsp;and time just becomes a <EM>torrent</EM>! </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Life&nbsp;is like that. </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>The lesson is to not seek, but to be present. The relativity of time is teaching us this lesson and when we are ready to receive the teaching it is very good news.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Being present is timeless. Being present is being as it is.&nbsp; Our discriminating mind, doing what it does, takes us away from this and thrusts us into the relativity of judgment, recrimination, and, expectation.&nbsp; This mind must be mastered, but to master  it is not to control it, it is to passively witness it. </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Going back to an image I frequently use:&nbsp; the motor is racing, but you don't have to put the car in gear. Let it race.&nbsp; And as it races, you are serenely reflecting on its racing. Hoping it will stop racing will slow time down. </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Be well.</DIV></DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><BR><BR><DIV><IMG src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/40.gif">Rev.
