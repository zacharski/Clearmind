With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />The silence of the early morning is broken by a siren in the distance. Like a bell, it brings me back to myself as I sit here to write to you.<br /><br />Morning is not delicate. Open space, it receives sound and light. When through the day, such sound and light is everywhere, morning is still morning.  Morning, an equivalent of zazen, does not require silence.<br /><br />Just as a mountain sits as the rain pounds it, the people trample on it, or fire burns it, so morning opens to the day. Mountain does not require separateness. Morning and mountain are the same as zazen.<br /><br />The river flows through the valley and as it flows it does not care whether a tree falls in it.  It embraces the tree. Eventually the tree and the river become one. The river does not require a path. Morning, mountain and river are the same as zazen.<br /><br />Sometimes it is our view of a thing that blinds us to seeing it.<br /><br />Be well.
