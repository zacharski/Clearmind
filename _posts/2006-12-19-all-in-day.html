With palms together,<br />Good Evening All,<br /><br />This morning was different...I did not feel like posting.  My apologies. After morning practice, My Little Honey and I went for a walk with our dogs. Then she went a-knitting and  I went back to the Zendo. It was good to be there. Regular zazen at the Zen Center is a wonderful, priestly task.  I enjoy puttering there, taking care of little things, like watering the plants or replacing the toilet paper and candles.<br /><br />Susana from Juarez, Mexico joined me at the afternoon practice period.  It was good to see her. She is such a good practitioner.  We sat upright, then talked over tea in the kitchen until My Little Honey stopped by to pick me up.  I rode my bike to Zen Center and it was pretty nasty outside on my ride in, but the weather had taken a turn for the worse since. We left the bike at Zen Center and headed home.<br /><br />Tonight I sat at home in my home Zendo.  I lit a stick of incense, bowed, and sat down.   The time was short, but the sitting was just perfect.  I then chanted the Maka Hanya Shin Gyo, Four Great Vows and quietly left the room.<br /><br />Today Student Mu Shin had a surgical procedure and my Aunt had a bone marrow test.  My prayers are with both.<br /><br />Be well.
