With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />Practice of the Buddha's Way requires our diligence and constant attention.  In fact, these <em>are</em> the Buddha Way. In the morning, we open our eyes and consider the universe with compassion.  We embrace our lives and embrace each other. This is our life.<br /><br />One does not <em>believe</em> in Buddha.  One does not <em>believe</em> in Dharma.  One does not <em>believe</em> in Sangha. There is no dogma, no doctrine, no belief at all. There is just the practice of noticing, the practice of loving, and the practice of embracing.<br /><br />In all of this, the core practice is faith: not in a God or a set of beliefs, but in ourselves and the universe. Such faith enables us to trust silence.  It enables us to trust others. It is these that are the most challenging aspects of our practice.<br /><br />Be well.
