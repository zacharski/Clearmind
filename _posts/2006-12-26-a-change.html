Good Morning All,<br /><br />Recently, I have decided to not blog daily on this site.  I will be posting different sorts of posts, more like commentaries, I suppose, on Zen practice and Buddhist Sutras. I will do these as I can.<br /><br />I have been writing this blog daily for a year now and I really need to break away from the habit of going to the computer first thing in the morning to write.<br /><br />I still blog at my Yahoo 360 site, however, and those notes are more of a personal, day-to-day nature.<br /><br />If interested, go to Yahoo 360 and type in my Yahoo ID, buddhist99<br /><br />Be well.
