With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br /><br /><div>This morning way before sunrise, I woke to go to a local church as I was invited to participate in an International Prayer for Peace. The air was chilly, 28 degrees. The church had a fairy large number of people there for a 5:00 AM service.  </div><div> </div><div>I dropped my cushion on the floor at the back, bowed, and took my seat.  Only the minister saw me enter. I enjoyed my small anonymity and listened to the various prayers as they were recited one after another: Muslim, Hindu, Jewish, Jain, Christian, Nichiren Buddhist, even a Native American prayer. I was asked to close the service with a few remarks. </div><div> </div><div>The prayers were beautiful. Most beseech God for peace and asked for a world of compassion and understanding.  So much desire for peace in that room.  I could feel the people's need for serenity, it was almost palpable.</div><div> </div><div>In between each prayer a bell was invited to ring. </div><div> </div><div>I sat with complete attention.</div><div> </div><div>When it came time for me to speak, I felt myself get up off my cushion and walk easily to the podium.  I placed my attention on my breath, looked out at the group, and began to speak. </div><div> </div><div>Peace, I said, was not something we should seek.  Peace is something we are.  We are peace when we set aside ourselves and our desires, our ego and our craving.  We are peace when we open ourselves to others and listen to them as they speak. This is the work of peacemaking. It is deeply challenging, but very rewarding work.</div><div> </div><div>This year I vow to not need to be in charge of anything. This year I vow to share. This year I vow to listen as deeply as I am capable to those addressing me. This year I vow to accept all beings as they are, warts and all. This year I vow to replace anger with love, hurt with compassion, and intolerance with patience. This is how peace happens. I know that I will not always be successful, but I vow to forgive myself when not and continue on with this work.  If nothing else, I believe we are all worth the effort.</div><div> </div><br />Be well.
