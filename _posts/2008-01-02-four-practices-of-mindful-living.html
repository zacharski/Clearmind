<div>Good Morning Everyone,</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>My hope is that each of you had a wonderful New Year's Day and that your life will be much improved as this year unfolds.&nbsp; When I say this, I don't mean&nbsp;your circumstances, but rather, <EM>your life</EM>.&nbsp; We often assume that our lives are our circumstances, but we all have circumstances, don't we?&nbsp; It is how we <EM>approach and encounter</EM> these circumstances that make our lives what they are.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>When&nbsp;each day dawns I make a vow to see the world as it is and free all beings in the process.&nbsp; This is an acknowledgment that Clear Mind and Zen Practice are one. Many of us struggle with this.&nbsp; We think that our circumstances, if improved, will make our lives better.&nbsp; In some respects this is true, I suppose.&nbsp; If we understand <EM>better</EM> to mean food on the table, a warm home, or recovery from illness.&nbsp; But if we mean <EM>better</EM>  to mean a larger TV screen, the latest fashion, or &nbsp;a new car, well this is just lust.&nbsp; We human beings regardless of our circumstances always envision better circumstances and too often "better" is framed by cultural or media tease and tinsel.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Clear Mind enables us to see directly, exactly, what is there.&nbsp; Zen is the approach of a full human being who is in sync with reality. Attitude adjusted.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>We do this through the Four Practices:&nbsp;the practice of Zazen (seated meditation), the practice of Kinhin (walking meditation), the practice of Oryoki (eating meditation),&nbsp; and the practice of Samu (work meditation).&nbsp; These are the practices of mindful living, the practices of Clear Mind Zen.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Be well.</div><BR><BR><DIV><FONT face=arial color=#007f7f size=3></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT face="comic sans ms" color=#007f7f size=3><STRONG><EM>Rev.
