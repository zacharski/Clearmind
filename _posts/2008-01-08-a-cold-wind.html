<div>Good Morning Everyone,</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Our car is repaired and we got it back last night just before Zen Judaism and just after streetZen.&nbsp; I am personally relieved. Being without a vehicle for nearly two weeks was a considerable stressor for this retired couple. </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>streetZen was a challenge yesterday afternoon. The day was windy and as the sun went down so did the temperatures.&nbsp; The result was that we sat in a very cold sustained wind in the 30 mph range. I wrapped myself in my serape, but it was billowing during the first sitting period.&nbsp; During the second period I wrapped it around my head and tucked the front under my knees so as to hold it down. </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Rev. Zento sat with me.&nbsp; It was good to have him there.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>As I sat there I remembered one night in 1964 when I stood guard duty in the dead of winter in Germany. It was so cold the tears from my eyes  froze on my face. Of course I was 17 at the time and thought I was God's gift to soldering, but those thoughts were little comfort against the cold.&nbsp; Still, they got me through that night.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Sitting last night in the cold desert wind I thought of the Buddha sitting himself alone in the forests of India. Nothing but a robe or two layered on his body. Yet, he sat in serene reflection.&nbsp;Goodness,&nbsp;I have much practice ahead of me, I can tell you that!</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>As those thoughts arose last night, I would let them go and place my attention back on my breath.&nbsp; I resorted to counting, which helped my concentration in the wind, and left me in the end, partners with the elements.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>May we walk together in peace and harmony.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Be well.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div><BR><BR><DIV><FONT face=arial color=#007f7f size=3></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>   <DIV><FONT face="comic sans ms" color=#007f7f size=3><STRONG><EM>Rev.
