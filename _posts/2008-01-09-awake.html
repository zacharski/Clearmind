<div>Good Morning Everyone,</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>When we sit down to practice zazen, we should sit down with a certain aim.&nbsp; This aim is to be open and present without attempting to have this thought or that; this state of consciousness or that; or this feeling or that.&nbsp; Zazen is the pure act of just sitting to be just sitting.&nbsp; </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>We practice zazen in order to be awake.&nbsp; Most of the time we are not awake, rather, we are thinking about something other than what we are doing.&nbsp; as I type just now, I am thinking I need to get off the computer to get to the grocery store before my Breakfast Club meeting at 9:00.&nbsp; This is not being awake.&nbsp; </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>We often confuse having our eyes open for being awake.&nbsp;Drivers are "awake" but often appear to have tombstones in their eyes, mesmerized by the monotony of traffic.&nbsp; Parents are often "awake" as they attend to their children with  their minds a couple of dozen miles away.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>This is no way to live.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Today practice for one hour to just be awake.&nbsp; Tat is just attending to what you are in fact doing and nothing else.&nbsp;Watch your mind as it tries to slip away, gently bring it back. </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>I'd like to hear about your experience.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Be well.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><BR><BR><DIV><FONT face=arial color=#007f7f size=3></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT face="comic sans ms" color=#007f7f size=3><STRONG><EM>Rev.
