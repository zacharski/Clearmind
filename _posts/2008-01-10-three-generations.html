<div>Good Morning Everone,</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Yesterday afternoon at the&nbsp; Peace Vigil I sat in serene reflection meditation on the sidewalk in front of the old federal building.&nbsp;The sun was still up and we practice facing west so the sun warms our skin against the cooling&nbsp;late afternoon desert air. &nbsp;Sometime during the second period, Abbey and her friend (I cannot recall her name)&nbsp;sat down next to me to practice a few minutes. Abbey is a high school student whose mother and grandmother stand with me during the peace vigil on Wednesdays.&nbsp; She is a tall young lady, with long blond hair, and a keen interest in the world. </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Over the last few weeks Abby has sat with me on a few occasions on the street.&nbsp; She has also&nbsp;written to me a couple of times with questions.&nbsp; Her questions suggest she has had a meditation practice for quite some time, but that her practice has been undisciplined.&nbsp;  Anyway, Abbey and her friend sat in silence, hands in the cosmic mudra, and brought peace into the world with me.&nbsp; It was a very good experience to sit with such young people.&nbsp; </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>I chanted the Four Great Vows as they prepared to leave as a family.&nbsp; Three generations of women committed to making a difference.&nbsp; I was honored to be in their presence.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div><EM>Beings are numberless, I vow to free them.</EM></div>  <div><EM>Delusions are&nbsp;inexhaustable, I vow to end them</EM></div>  <div><EM>Dharma gates are boundless, I vow to enter them.</EM></div>  <div><EM>The Buddha Way is unsurpassable, I vow to realize it.</EM></div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Be well.</div><BR><BR><DIV><FONT face=arial color=#007f7f size=3></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT face="comic sans ms" color=#007f7f size=3><STRONG><EM>Rev.
