<div>Good Morning Everyone,</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>This morning I want to talk about Kinhin.&nbsp; Kinhin is walking meditation.&nbsp; It is essentially stillness in motion. There is a formal and informal version of this practice.&nbsp; Formal Kinhin is practiced in the Zendo between sitting periods.&nbsp; Informal kinhin is practiced anywhere at anytime.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Formal Kinhin should be done in the following way.&nbsp; Standing at your cushion, facing the wall, place your hands in gassho (prayer-like hand gesture), with elbows&nbsp;extended and forearms horizontal to the floor. Then bow from the waist.&nbsp; Turn to your right.&nbsp; Close your left hand into a fist with thumb surrounded by your fingers.&nbsp; Place your right hand on top as if to cover it like a shield. With elbows extended, forearms should remain horizontal to the floor.&nbsp; Step off with your right foot.&nbsp; Each step should be like a half step and very slow.&nbsp;  Kinhin is practiced slowly and mindfully.&nbsp; Breathing in, we step, breathing out, we step.&nbsp; Our attention should be on our presence as we walk.&nbsp; </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Typically Kinhin is practiced by walking around the interior of the Zendo following the practice leader.&nbsp; This can be a set amount of time or a set number of rotations.&nbsp; In any case, remain present and awake.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Informal Kinhin can be practiced anywhere and&nbsp;it is a real favorite of mine. Step slowly, but deliberately, with hands easy and relaxed either at one's side or in&nbsp;an informal&nbsp;clasped hand gesture, left cradled in right.&nbsp; If you are wearing your rakusu (short robe), your hands should be under it.&nbsp; Walk with your mind on your walking.&nbsp; Notice your feet touch the earth, rise and fall as you walk.&nbsp; Notice the sounds in the air, the smells, the sights of the earth before you.&nbsp; </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>   <div>If you are in a store, say grocery shopping, move slowly with your cart.&nbsp; Feel the products you examine, Notice how you place them in your cart.&nbsp; Smile to others, but remain focused on being present.&nbsp; We practice being free and easy in the marketplace this way.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Sometimes I practice kinhin while running, by placing my complete attention on my feet and breath.&nbsp; Noticing my body as it moves, feeling the wind as it passes over my skin, and so forth.&nbsp; I often listen to my brace as it squeaks when I walk or run.&nbsp; Try to avoid patterns, stay in the exact moment.&nbsp; Patterns make for sleepy Zen.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Practice Kinhin today and let me know about your experience.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Be well.</div><BR><BR><DIV><FONT face=arial color=#007f7f size=3></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT face="comic sans ms" color=#007f7f size=3><STRONG><EM>Rev.
