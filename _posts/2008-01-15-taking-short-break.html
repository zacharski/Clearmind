<div>Hello All,</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Just a quick note to let you know I'm taking a short break from writing.&nbsp; My Little Honey had surgery on her nose yesterday to remove a malignant basal cell carcinoma, my son in Florida is having a rather sticky heart procedure Friday, and I am just plan tired.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Please keep Judy and Jason in your prayers.&nbsp; Also, my former Disciple Rev. Sam Kokyo is having a hip replaced tomorrow and we will attend his partner Mary Ellen in the surgery waiting room.&nbsp; Keep him in your thoughts as well.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Lastly, thank you Deana Kessin, for keeping me company while Judy was being treated in the hospital outpatient surgery center.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Meditation at the synagogue went well and I have double the number of students&nbsp;I expected to have in my spirituality class at the Academy of Jewish Learning. I guess there is a demand for a JuBu Zen&nbsp;priest  :)</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Anyway, </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Be well.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div><BR><BR><DIV><FONT face=arial color=#007f7f size=3></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT face="comic sans ms" color=#007f7f size=3><STRONG><EM>Rev.
