<DIV>Good Morning Everyone,</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>This morning is again a cold one.&nbsp; The temps are in the low twenties and I am scheduled to go sit in front of the environmental center.&nbsp; Sitting Zazen in the cold is no fun.&nbsp; I've noticed that my nose runs, eyes water, and internal things begin to shake. This can't be good.&nbsp; </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>I am cancelling my morning outdoor sits until the morning temps are above 35. </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>I missed the Wednesday Peace Vigil due to Rev. Kokyo's surgery.&nbsp; It was supposed to be in the early morning, but it was moved to the afternoon.&nbsp; So it goes.&nbsp; Life is full of little twists and turns and the more quickly we get to a point where we relax into them the better. Just like on a motorcycle, you don't resist leaning into the curve.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Learning to let go is really important.&nbsp; Last night we attended Chef Jacob's opening night at <A  href="http://www.mesondemesilla.com/">Meson de Mesilla</A>.&nbsp; It was an unexpectedly large crowd, every table full, the lounge crowded, and a very green kitchen staff.&nbsp; I stepped back to the&nbsp;kitchen a few times.&nbsp; The wait staff were really stressed.&nbsp;The cooks were very stressed.&nbsp;I invited them to breath free and easy.&nbsp; We smiled together.&nbsp; And while this didn't speed things up, it may have helped them settle their internal engines just a little.&nbsp; </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>As with anything intense, it is very important to learn to relax within the intensity.&nbsp; While running, for example, a runner can place their attention on their calf muscles and relax them with each step.&nbsp; The same for our arms, chests, and shoulders.&nbsp; The key is learning to notice the muscle groups and understand that we have real control over them when we decide we can take it.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>An easy breath with a smile and  pleasant thought in the middle of yuk is always a welcome, if brief, relief.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>The evening at Meson was extraordinarily delicious.&nbsp; The music was wonderful.&nbsp; The atmosphere elegant.&nbsp; If any of you ever get to Las Cruces, please visit.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Be well.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><BR><BR><DIV><FONT face=arial color=#007f7f size=3></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT face="comic sans ms" color=#007f7f size=3><STRONG><EM>Rev.
