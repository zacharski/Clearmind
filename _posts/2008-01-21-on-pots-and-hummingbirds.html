<div>Good Morning Everyone,</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Yesterday at the&nbsp;El Paso Sangha, I offered at teiso on everyday life.&nbsp; I used a portion of Master Dogen's <EM>Tenzo Kyokun (Instructions for the Cook), </EM>translated by Uchiyama-roshi of the Soto tradition,.and a portion of the book,&nbsp;Novice to Master by Morinaga-roshi of the Rinzai tradition.&nbsp; One of the fundamental tenets of our practice -- Soto or Rinzai--&nbsp;is this:&nbsp; there is no trash.&nbsp;The second fundamental derives&nbsp;as,: everything is sacred, but nothing is special.&nbsp; This means we should honor the everyday, finding in the everyday everything we need.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Yet, we human beings go around marking things as special.&nbsp; We invest things with meaning. </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>This is why we suffer so: Everything, <EM>special or ordinary, </EM>&nbsp;dissolves over time and returns to the Source.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>So, on the one  hand, we should recognize the sacred is the everyday, and on the other hand, we should not endeavour to hold onto it.&nbsp; We should practice with the knowledge that everything is transitory.&nbsp; Everything.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>How do we do this practice?&nbsp; By opening ourself up. Or, as Uchiyama-roshi suggests, opening the hand of thought.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Its rather like scrubbing out a pot caked with pudding residue.&nbsp; We just scrub, noticing the transformational nature of the process.&nbsp; Or like holding out our finger at a hummingbird feeder, generating warm and loving thoughts,&nbsp;and remaining very still. A hummingbird will perch on the finger offered.&nbsp; We can only witness this; feel the tiny, lovely body on our finger, but we cannot grasp it. </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>So, as we add "lovely" and "warm" to our experience of the hummingbird, it is fleeting and no more special than cleaning a pot. Both are in the moment  experiences&nbsp;both are transitory, both are special, and both are everyday..</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Be well.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>.&nbsp; </div><BR><BR><DIV><FONT face=arial color=#007f7f size=3></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT face="comic sans ms" color=#007f7f size=3><STRONG><EM>Rev.
