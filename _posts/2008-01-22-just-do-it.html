<div>Good Morning Everyone,</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Its a nice chilly morning and I am preparing now for my morning run.&nbsp; I just did my weight work in my bathroom dumbbell gym: bicep curls, tricep kickbacks, delt raises, and shrugs.&nbsp; I am doing one set of twenty reps in the morning, afternoon, and evening with the heaviest weight I can manage for that number of reps. I was going to go for a walk with my friend Abe, but he could not muster himself and my training partner, Katie, isn't feeling very well.&nbsp; So, I am on my own.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Life is like that.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>We partner with people, draw on their support, but in the end&nbsp;it is our own effort and willingness to get&nbsp;down and do the thing that really counts.&nbsp; </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Yesterday I sat alone at the Veteran's Park.&nbsp; The air was not particularly cold, but I wore a thermal insulated shirt under my robe. It was a peaceful two  periods of Zazen.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>From there I went to Temple Beth El where I led two periods of&nbsp;meditation.&nbsp; This was a good little group.&nbsp; We even had one of my Zen students attend, Sara Moren.&nbsp; It was a delight to see her!&nbsp; She has spent the last few weeks at San Francisco Zen Center and has just applied for a eight week program there.&nbsp;</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>After meditation we sat with cups of tea in the social hall and talked a bit.&nbsp; Community is an important ingredient in our practice. </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>I look forward to sitting at the Federal Building in Las Cruces&nbsp;on Wednesday at 4:00 PM.&nbsp; If you are up to it, come join me!</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Be well.&nbsp;</div><BR><BR><DIV><FONT face=arial color=#007f7f size=3></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT face="comic sans ms" color=#007f7f size=3><STRONG><EM>Rev.
