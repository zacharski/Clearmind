<div>Good Afternoon Everyone,</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Zen is a way of life, indeed, it is life itself.&nbsp; When we practice Zen we are alive and awake.&nbsp; When we do not practice Zen we are asleep and dead. No special tools are required, just a willingness to open our eyes to see and our lungs to breathe.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>This morning I made a tuna salad for our breakfast club.&nbsp; The pups, Pepper and, rounded the corner as soon as they heard the hand cranked can opener at work.&nbsp; Pete-kitty followed close behind. All waited patiently -- and not so patiently -- as I emptied the can, chopped the onion, and mixed the relish, peas, and spices, into the tuna.&nbsp; </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Pete-kitty was insistent, but he really does not like tuna.&nbsp; Tripper was doing near back flips to get at the can.&nbsp; Pepper, old dog that he is, waited patiently.&nbsp; I gave him a small chunk of tuna and topped it off with a dog biscuit, as I  slipped the near empty can to Tripper.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>During this whole live theatre, I kept awake.&nbsp; Opening the can I was aware I was opening the can.&nbsp; Dealing with tails-a-waggin' I was aware I was dealing with tails-a-waggin'; mixing the salad I was aware I was mixing the salad. &nbsp;I&nbsp;witnessed&nbsp;without reference to self, just opening, dealing,&nbsp;mixing, each in their appropriate turn and place.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>I am always aware of where this food comes from; aware of the lives offered to be food itself; and of the many hands involved in bringing it to me. Pete-kitty is not as aware, nor is Tripper or Pepper.&nbsp; They just smell food and salivate until they can get their teeth into it.&nbsp; We human beings are fortunate.&nbsp; We have the ability to practice Zen.&nbsp; We have the capacity to be awake and alive.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>A bow to each of you.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>   <div>&nbsp;</div><BR><BR><DIV><FONT face=arial color=#007f7f size=3></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT face="comic sans ms" color=#007f7f size=3><STRONG><EM>Rev.
