<div>Good Morning Everyone,</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>In life it is always a good idea to be open to your actual experience.&nbsp; We tend to live in our thoughts so much that we are really not as open as we could be.&nbsp; The result is a constant strain to keep things from changing.&nbsp; An impossible task, of course, as life itself is constant change.&nbsp; But if we live in our thoughts, the real, actual world does not have an opportunity to present itself as it is.&nbsp; This is very sad because if we keep things from changing, against the natural order of things, then we live in death itself.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>As I write to you this morning, for example, I sit with Pete-kitty on my right and Tripper, the cockapoo, on my left.&nbsp; Both are sleeping, but in close proximity to me in the middle. The coffee is ready.&nbsp; I have to go to my cushion shortly. And in&nbsp;just two sentences I am not sitting here with you.&nbsp; Did you notice?</div>   <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>This is important because we live in relationship either to others or to our physical world.&nbsp; When we cut ourselves off from the living nature of our relationships we die. </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Life is like that, so our vigilance toward living awake must be constant and real.&nbsp; We should check ourselves with nearly every breath.&nbsp; It is in every breath that we create ourselves.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>On a personal note: The last couple of days have been a bit of a challenge.&nbsp; My Little Honey is not well.&nbsp; She has a chest cold and nagging cough that has resulted in a very irritated throat.&nbsp; I hope she wakes this morning feeling a little better today.&nbsp; We have had to cancel things and she cannot teach religious school this morning at the Temple. Neither of us get sick very often, but when we do, geeez, its a lulu. Son Jason came through his heart procedure nicely and my mother has returned home from  the rehab center.&nbsp; Also, it seems one of two expecting nieces delivered her baby yesterday!</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Life is change, indeed.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Be well.</div><BR><BR><DIV><FONT face=arial color=#007f7f size=3></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT face="comic sans ms" color=#007f7f size=3><STRONG><EM>Rev.
