<div>Good Morning Everyone,</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>So, we sit down on a cushion, face a wall, place our palms together, bow, take up the cosmic mudra and practice presence. We breathe in, we breathe out.&nbsp; We let our self fall away. As we and the Infinite realize our oneness. Then a bell rings, we bow, rise and perhaps recite a sutra or some vows and move on through our day. So?</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Unless we carry those vows, the essential nature of the sutra, the essential connection with the Infinite gained on that cushion into the world, our sitting is meaningless.&nbsp; When you read these words what is your experience?</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>When your partner is crabby or your boss a jerk or traffic deeply, tightly congested, what is your experience?</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>This is your real practice.&nbsp; The cushion is essential, but still only prep work.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Do the prep, then walk the walk.</div>   <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Be well.</div><BR><BR><DIV><FONT face=arial color=#007f7f size=3></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT face="comic sans ms" color=#007f7f size=3><STRONG><EM>Rev.
