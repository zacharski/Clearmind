<div>Good Morning Everyone,</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>It is cold enough outside that our heater clicked on this morning sending warmth throughout the condo. I have mixed feelings about this as heat costs and money is in short supply. Our refuge in the mountains was a bit simpler though more difficult.&nbsp;&nbsp;We chopped wood for the stove, built a fire and in an hour or two the house began to warm.&nbsp; The differences, aside from the obvious, were in the deliberate nature of life. Living wasn't automatic.&nbsp; </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>If&nbsp;we wanted clean dishes,&nbsp;we washed them by hand with water collected from our roof and pumped up to a tank on the hill behind the refuge so gravity would send it back into the house. If&nbsp;we wanted to cook,&nbsp;we made a fire and waited for the cookstove to get hot enough to cook.&nbsp;When&nbsp;we needed something from the store, it was a day trip. &nbsp;Nothing happened on its own.&nbsp;&nbsp;We were  intimately involved with living.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Here in the city, we live much more in our heads as our bodies do very little and are, comparatively, &nbsp;far less involved.&nbsp;For myself, I miss the deliberate and intimate life the refuge afforded me. It was harder, to be sure, and I don't really believe I should go back to it full time, but I still yearn for that connection with life itself.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>To&nbsp;make such a connection we must make it.&nbsp; Jews have a way of phrasing things that says this.&nbsp; We <EM>"make Shabbos"</EM>&nbsp; we <EM>"make a blessing"</EM>&nbsp; and so on.&nbsp; Or, as my grandfather used to say, he was going to <EM>"make water"</EM> when he went to the bathroom. </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>What these mean is that we create our connection through our activity by being conscious of the activity as we do it.&nbsp; We are partners with the Absolute in our own creation. Life is never singular.</div>   <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>If you want a spiritual life you must make your life spiritual and to do this you must become intimate and deliberate in its making.&nbsp; </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Be well.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><BR><BR><DIV><FONT face=arial color=#007f7f size=3></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT face="comic sans ms" color=#007f7f size=3><STRONG><EM>Rev.
