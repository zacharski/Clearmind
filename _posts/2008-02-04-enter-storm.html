<DIV>Good Morning Everyone,</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>For one who is one with the storm, there is no storm. Separating ourselves from the storm, resisting it, makes&nbsp;the storm strong.&nbsp; If we practice relaxing into the storm, peace.&nbsp;We oppose it, become&nbsp;an oak tree, unbending, rigid, we will be&nbsp;uprooted.&nbsp;Not resisting the storm we are&nbsp;like a palm tree in a hurricane, bending and yielding to the wind,&nbsp;we become the wind itself: storm and&nbsp;we are one, no problem.&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Do storms cause damage?&nbsp; Of course.&nbsp; Should we not prepare for them?&nbsp; Of course.&nbsp; But our attitude and willingness to be present determines both the extent of the damage and most importantly, our experience of the storm itself.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Zen teaches us to be free and easy in the marketplace.&nbsp; Open and accepting of difference, we become adaptive, we struggle less, we are interested in the  world around us for itself as opposed to its use-value. </DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>There is an old Daoist concept of going to the low places.&nbsp;By this is meant&nbsp;relaxing into the world around us, like water does, forming still pools at the lowest places of any environment, not resisting gravity, but going&nbsp;with it.&nbsp; We yield to the rocks, wash around the trees and leaves, and flow to create pools in shady coves.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>When we live life like this we live in serene reflection meditation.</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>Be soft, be yielding, be peace, be well..&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><BR><BR><DIV><FONT face=arial color=#007f7f size=3></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT face="comic sans ms" color=#007f7f size=3><STRONG><EM>Rev.
