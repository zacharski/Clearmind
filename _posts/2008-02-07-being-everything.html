<div>Good Morning Everyone,</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Someone on a blog this morning suggested I was rather narrow in my themes.&nbsp; I thought it a curious perspective.&nbsp; Admittedly, I write mostly about religious/spiritual themes, but I try to talk about them in a very wide spectrum of applications, anywhere from teacups to space-time relativity.&nbsp; In any event, the comment gave me pause and I reflected for a bit on it.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Most of us tend to compartmentalize our lives: this is religion, that is cooking, this other thing is sports, and over here is work.&nbsp; My consistent point of view is that this is not only false, but spiritually dangerous. Its part of the reductionism that was epidemic in the 19th and 20th centuries.&nbsp; It even has lead scientists to try to find a God spot in our brains, for goodness sake. </div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Spiritual life is a whole life.&nbsp; Its about seeing everything as our life, our  breath, and our intimate connection to everything else. We are not separate, but completely one.&nbsp; When we talk about being a Christian, or a Jew, or a Muslim, or a Buddhist, we should keep in mind that these are just labels for paths to the same thing: actualization&nbsp;with and as&nbsp;the Infinite.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>I don't like clubs, especially exclusive clubs.&nbsp; Although&nbsp;it wasn't always so, I practice inclusiveness as much as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important for us to realize we create our own issues when we treat a stranger as somehow different from ourselves.&nbsp; This acceptance of everything, however, is not permission to be crazy or hurtful or to tolerate such things in others. Part&nbsp;of a&nbsp;disciplined spiritual practice is learning to say no, at least as easily as we say yes.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>When we practice meditation, we are creating a space for this oneness to be seen through the very discipline  of&nbsp;acceptance without attachment or avoidance.&nbsp; As we sit quietly, thoughts arise, feelings emerge, and we might want to follow them.&nbsp; We gently notice them and return to being present.&nbsp; We begin to see everything appears related to everything else: thoughts relate to other thoughts, feelings relate to other feelings, and all of these relate to each other.&nbsp; It is a perfect storm and we are its eye.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Be well.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>&nbsp; </div><BR><BR><DIV><FONT face=arial color=#007f7f size=3></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>  <DIV><FONT face="comic sans ms" color=#007f7f size=3><STRONG><EM>Rev.
