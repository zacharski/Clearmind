Good Morning Everyone,<br />Yesterday afternoon I sat zazen at the Federal Building bearing witness for peace.  It was a wonderful practice period with a few people who have become Wednesday afternoon allies.  We practice in virtual silence with an increasing number of honks of horns in support over the last two years I've been at this. We rarely get a negative comment, rarely.<br />In fact, yesterday we had a press person visit us and do interviews while some attorney stopped by to offer his support for our work.  These are not uncommon occurrences.  Even the construction workers give up thumbs up as they pass by us. <br /><br />I think peace is on every one's mind and the only real question is how to best achieve it. <br /><br />My point of view is really simple, but perhaps I am a simple person, peace comes when we become peace.<br /><br />Be well.
