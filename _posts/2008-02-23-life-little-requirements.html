<div align="justify">Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />This morning I made a nice breakfast for My Little Honey and me. I fired up the oven and whipped up some biscuits, while frying each of us one egg, over medium, and one fake sausage.  Served with butter and strawberry jam, the pups were drooling before the plates got to the table.<br /><br />Sipping coffee, we are now attending to our individual Internet business, she working on a second novel, me scribbling to you.  Pete-kitty is curled on a chair by the window, Tripper is curled on the floor below him and wise old Pepper is sleeping at my feet.<br /><br />In a little bit I've got to get changed and walk over to the synagogue for Talmud study. After that, I go to the downtown mall for a peace vigil. Its another Saturday and I'm feeling a bit guilty for not having gone to synagogue last night. We rarely miss, but there are times when its best to stay away, and since My Little Honey isn't quite up to snuff, this was one of those times.<br /><br />Life is like that, you know. Our willingness to flow with change is a mark of our spiritual well-being. Sticks tend to break, while branches often bend.  Our willingness to stay connected allows a healthy flow of nutrients and the water necessary for our pliability.  Break yourself off from the community or family and you dry up, become brittle, and are far more easily broken.<br /><br />If we remain within our practice regardless of where we are, then our practice becomes our refuge, our reality, and our community.  Like life, it must be pliable and connected.  It requires water and nourishment. It requires sunlight and fresh air.  Those who practice in the dark, live in the dark, and as a result, cannot withstand the light.<br /><br />Be well.</div>
