Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />The Buddha taught that we should be very careful to see clearly, in fact, seeing clearly and being completely at ease with what is there, is a sort of code pointing to awakening.  If I say "this is a cup" and my mind has fixed itself of "cupness" I am not really seeing the object I am calling a cup. I am seeing with my mind's eye. And if we see someone about to harm us?  How do we see clearly then? <br /><br />In the martial arts, it is very important to develop an ability to make your mind like water.  Still water reflects accurately what is around it.  It fixes on nothing. In Zen, we do the same.  We call this non-attachment.  Non-attachment means non-investment.  We suffer in direct proportion to our emotional investment in something we perceive we are about to lose.<br /><br />So, self seems central. Our mind's eye records for the self; it is in service to the self.  Unless we re-wire it.  Training to let go of self, lets go of fear, and fear distorts, causing ripples in the water. Training to let go of attachments, non-investment in outcomes, is key to our success and allows us to see clearly. <br /><br />So, someone is trying to harm you.  You are unconcerned about yourself.  You can see him clearly. His suffering, his pain, his craziness.  You can meet his needs, sidestep his assault, embrace his pain. You live; he lives: two have not just survived, but thrived.  The seeds of kindness and compassion have been watered.<br /><br />What is a cup if not a cup?  Cup is just a concept, a word.  The thing itself is what life is all about. Live without the labels, live without fear.  Know there is no "live", no "die". Be present.<br /><br />Be a blessing.
