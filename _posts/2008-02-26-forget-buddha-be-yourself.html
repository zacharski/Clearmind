Good Morning All,<br />Sometimes we can "know" the Buddha too much. We read his words, study his life, and think we have an idea of what it is to be a Buddha. This is the precise moment we should kill him, cut him into little pieces and spread him on the ground to serve as compost.<br />Keeping the Buddha prevents you from being a buddha. He becomes a mouthpiece only, so you cannot speak, but to mouth his words, dry and stale as they might be, and offering little nourishment to the world. Or maybe he becmes your clothes and you wear him like a talisman on your body.  Forget him. Be yourself.<br />_____<br />An Offering<br /><br />Time to get naked. <br />Time to let yourself come out. <br />It is you, afterall,<br />Who is the real Buddha,<br />Not some dusty words on paper,<br />Or puke from a teacher's mouth.<br />When the teacher teaches, run.<br />Find your own place in the sun.<br />Then open your self ---<br />And be.<br />_____<br />See ya.
