Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />This morning I will be hiking with a new friend who is here in the condo complex for a short time, as he lives in the Virgin Islands. The weather is cooperating, I think.  Its supposed to be sunny with a high near 70 today.  Currently, its 43 degrees outside. Delightful for a morning hike through the desert.<br /><br />Some people enjoy company on their runs.  While I will enjoy this man's company for a hike this morning,  I confess, I do not enjoy company during training runs, in particular.  While I welcome an occasional training partner, like my friend Katie, I would rather be alone on distance runs. Part of the reason for this is the value of concentration during training.  Its one of the reasons silence is thunder during meditation retreats.<br /><br />Training is a relationship with interior awareness and experience of a challenge.  We say we will run hills, a set of four, six, eight, or ten hill repeats.  Or we set out to do speed repeats.  Or a long slow run to increase endurance.  Each of these sets our interior world against an exterior challenge of mind, body, and spirit.<br /><br />Just so, sesshin, the Zen practice of secluded, extended, silent meditation.<br /><br />In each experience we are required to come to terms with ourselves as we approach and touch our limits.  Sometimes we move past these limits by simply dissociating from our internal discomfort, we distract ourselves with mental tricks, jokes, etc., but this is not really a good way, in my opinion, as it takes us out of touch with what is actually going on and, in physical training, this can lead to injury. <br /><br />The best approach is the Zen approach: complete presence with perseverance.<br /><br />So, this morning, as I walk  in the desert with my new friend, I will be aware that my attention is being divided between my footsteps and my mouth; between my body and our need to interact.  In such a case, training becomes secondary as relationship becomes primary, and through this, enjoyment of the experience is made possible. This is what happens when I walk with My Little Honey, which I thoroughly enjoy.<br /><br />I have not trained with Katie for a couple of weeks now.  I miss going out with her.  Maybe, if she reads this, she will go out with me on Thursday morning to run some hills.<br /><br />Be well.
