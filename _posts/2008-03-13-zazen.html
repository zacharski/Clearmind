Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br />One should not sit without a time keeper.  If not in a Zendo with a timekeeper, use a timer.  I use my wrist watch alarms.  Each period is 25 minutes. You can use less or more, but to sit without a time limit allows for Sloppy Zen.  Sloppy Zen is Zen without discipline.  Sloppy Zen is anything goes Zen.<br /><br />Last night at Zen Judaism, a participant talked about his experience of "seeing the light" by which I believe he meant, slipping into a deeply relaxed state where time essentially stopped.  This is one type of meditation practice, but it is not zazen.  If our aim in our practice is to relax, allow stress to dissipate from our mind-mind, then this "seeing the light" meditation is useful.  If our aim, however, is to be present regardless of environmental or internal factors and without getting stuck on them or by them, this is not effective practice. <br /><br />Zazen, Shikantaza Zen, is the Zen of the Buddhas and ancestors.  It is what Master Dogen calls "practice realization" and goes beyond just sitting on a cushion. <br /><br />To practice shikantaza, just sit with an open mind, a mind that refuses to grasp or seek.<br /><br />A timer is essential because we cannot be thinking about when to stop.  Our practice period is predetermined.<br /><br />Please enjoy this practice.<br /><br />Be well.<br /><br />Workout Note:  This morning I did a short one mile walk/jog with Katie, then did six hill repeats. getting my heart-rate to 90% of its max on two and 80% on four of the repeats.  My Left Foot was not behaving and I neglected to wear my brace --- a not so good combination.  Anyway, at home I did: two sets of twenty push-ups, three sets of bent dumbbell rows, and three sets of dead lifts.
