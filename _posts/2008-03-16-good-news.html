Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />The morning air is wonderful: cool, but not cold, with a slight early morning breeze gently moving the blinds so that they perform like  wind instruments in an orchestra. I am sitting on the sofa with Tripper and some coffee, listening to these and other dawn sounds. There were times in my life when I would wish to be carried away by the wind, but no longer.  At this place in my life, I would prefer to just reside and appreciate whatever presents itself. Gentle breeze or storm, each should be equally welcome as they are only gentle or stormy as we apply the notions.<br /><br />This is the practice and we are never always in its embrace.<br /><br />There are times when we wish just to be left alone to reside peacefully in our thoughts.  There are times when we are less able to be pliant or even simply present. We practice to make these moments less frequent and more brief in duration.  Just so, we practice Zen as life.<br /><br />Yesterday we finally leased our vacant condo!  A great relief and welcome cash to our strained budget.  We also made preparations for My Little Honey's book-signing today.  A lot of flurry and if I were wearing robes yesterday, they would have been a-flapping.  But I wasn't always present, not always joyful or appreciative of the day's events as they unfolded.  I had my own agenda tucked into the recesses of my mind: sit, play chess, enjoy the day, take a walk in the desert...you know, that sort of thing.<br /><br />So while the morning was filled with such delights as Talmud study, Morning Services, a nice lunch; the afternoon, after leasing the condo out furnished, was full of shopping and going and preparing and discussing, none of which I am particularly good at.<br /><br />The good news is that the tensions are very short in duration and far less frequent than they were historically.  Why?  Practice.   It is good to be a work in progress, let us continue to be in progress through infinity. <br /><br />Be well.<br /><br />_______________________<br />For those on the Zen Living List: It is delightful to see such excellent interaction on the list.  Awareness is essential, coupled with a willingness to not press the SEND key in the heat of a moment, but rather, to take a few breaths, step away from your work, then come back later with a refreshed perspective.
