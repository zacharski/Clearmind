With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />As you probably are already aware, this is the fifth anniversary of the beginning of the Iraq War. Thousands dead and wounded, billions spent, and a mortgage that will last for several decades in terms of treatment for permanent veteran disabilities, family disruptions, and economic chaos.<br /><br />Please pray for an end to this disaster, a speedy delivery of our troops home, and a peaceful future. <br /><br />Also during your prayers, keep in mind the religious and ethnic freedom of our Tibetan brothers and sisters, as well as oppressed people everywhere.<br /><br />Spring is coming to our hemisphere, let it bring signs of hope through our behavior.<br /><br />Be well.
