With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />The noise of the dishwasher is loud, but rhythmic, and I notice my mind follows its cycle with no effort at all. As this synchronicity happens, I easily let go of the sound since nothing clashes. Harmony.<br /><br />The Buddha taught the Middle Way, a way that when followed, produces harmony with all things, all aspects of our life. Yet, sometimes discord is necessary.  Sometimes we must eschew harmony in order to right a wrong. Wherefore?<br /><br />Because we are or seek to be in harmony with the universe does not mean that others are as well.  Tibetan monks are in harmony, they follow the Middle Way, practice with great diligence, and because this is so, are deeply offended by the oppressive tactics of their Chinese invaders.<br /><br />The Japanese monks during the years preceding and during World War II were in harmony, but were so culturally fixated on order as the highest good that they failed to address the oppressive and militaristic nationalism of their own country.<br /><br />In one case, order imposed is seen as a disturbance of the Way, in another, order imposed is the way.<br /><br />The lesson here is that harmony must come from within and has little to do with a social order.  Oppression is oppression regardless of what it is in service to.  When we are serene reflection, we are like water: we become a flood,  meeting oppression and surround it with our harmony.  We prevent it from standing alone. We erode it with compassion and deep listening.  We do not just let it be, fading away into monasteries or practice centers.<br /><br />In the world today, as in any day, some wish to oppress and exploit others, sometimes even with the highest motives, but we must be alert to this and understand that the method corrupts the motive and only evil remains.  We vow not to do evil, we vow to do good, and we vow to bring about good for all beings,  We cannot accomplish these vows without action.<br /><br />Social action must however be done with a harmonious mind, a clear mind.  As the noise of the dishwasher rises, my mind meets it and finds its cadence.  Noise becomes melody.  And as war rages, invasions happen, exploitation and starvation, rape and violence continue, we rise to meet them with our own harmony. We witness for another way, a peaceful, embracing, and loving way.  Saying no does not require a bat, but it does require a compassionate heart.<br /><br />Be well.
