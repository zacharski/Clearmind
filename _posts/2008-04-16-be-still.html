With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />This morning's air is delicious!  Cool, fresh, and still. I know that by this afternoon it will turn into the winds common in our spring here in New Mexico. For now, in this moment, though, it is still.<br /><br />One of the things I so appreciate about morning is its stillness.  I hear some birds singing along with the occasional coo and hoot of desert birds. Its a wonderful thing.  Most of our neighbors are retired and so we don't have the ruckus of cars starting for the morning drive to work.  We are left with just the sound remaining in a world that lacks busy-ness.<br /><br />Yesterday was PrayerWorks, a monthly luncheon event hosted by Rabbi Kane's wife, Cyrille.  It is a really positive experience to gather together asking for the healing of others. So often we go through our day without much thought for the well-being of our friends, the well-being of our community, so self-absorbed we can become. A deliberate practice of gathering together, reflecting on inspirational readings, and asking the Infinite for the blessing of healing, helps us to reapportion our lives according to the needs of others.<br /><br />When we decide to commit to a disciplined spiritual practice that includes at its base a commitment to look outside of ourselves to the world around us, we are committing to a life of healing.  Paradoxically, we heal. Life is like that, you know, but we must first make the commitment, be still, and open our hearts to the universe.<br /><br />May your day be a day of joy and goodwill.<br /><br />Be well.
