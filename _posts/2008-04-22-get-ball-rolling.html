With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />This morning I plan to go for a run of sorts with my friend, Katie.  It will be a desert trail run and I'm looking forward to it.  I have not been training as hard as I should of late, so maybe today I'll be able to kick it a bit. Maybe a few hill repeats are in order.<br /><br />Consistency is vital. Habit energy is the strongest sort of human energy, I think. Like the proverbial ball rolling is hard to stop, so too, its hard to get rolling again.  Best to just roll, because once "on a roll" its easy to continue to do so.<br /><br />I've noticed our chief enemy to consistency is our Small Mind.  It wishes to take us away from the Big Mind "roll".  We might say to ourselves, "Aw, I don't feel like it"  or "I just can't get myself out there today...my ______________ hurts."<br /><br />Just Small Mind at work.  Kick it.  Get into that Big Mind space, expansive, open, inclusive. positive.<br /><br />We should do this with everything: physical training, zazen, prayer, compassion, relationship building and relationship maintenance.  Everything.<br /><br />Another way of saying this is to let the self fall away to be enlightened by the myriad things.<br /><br />Be well.
