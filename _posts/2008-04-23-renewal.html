With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Waking up in the morning, I am aware of just how precious a new day is: it should not be taken for granted.<br /><br />We can chose to just get through it, doing what we do to take care of ourselves.  We can chose to do something for the world, to make it a better place . We can chose to live as if each moment were a blessing in itself. <br /><br />So, what will I do with this day?  What will you do with this day?<br /><br />Often, the thing that renews the world renews you. Maybe that's a good place to start.<br /><br />Be well.
