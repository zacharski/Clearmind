With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Yesterday I spent the afternoon at Temple Beth El.  I teach three classes in a row: Jewish Spirituality, Jewish History, and Advanced Jewish Spirituality.  By the end of the day I am swimming in Judaism. Not a bad thing, really. but cause for a period of rest.  I was reading a book by Rabbi Zalman M. Schachter-Shalomi the other day and he presented me with a wonderful tool. He calls it "making a ten minute Shabbot (Sabbath)". <br /><br />The Sabbath is a break from ordinary time, as Rabbi Zalman points out, there is "doing" time and "being" time.  (Master Dogen of the 13th century pointed out the same from a Zen point of view.) Being time is full, natural time, not clock time, not calendar time, but time in the present moment, in sync with your natural, human rhythm.<br /><br />We can each "make" a ten minute sabbath by taking leave of the clock and joining the natural universe, either when we need it or during a break time in our busy day.  We do this by stopping what we are doing, perhaps changing our environment by walking outside, or even, as Jon Kabat-Zinn pointed out, lying down on the floor (to get a different perspective), and then paying attention. <br /><br />During our ten minute Shabbot, we release ourselves from work.  We smell the air, breath deeply, relax our muscles, let the tension in our bodies drift away. This is a time for rest and renewal.  In Zen we call it Zazen.<br /><br />At the conclusion of our ten minutes, we return to our day knowing that our day, and the work it involves, is our connection with the world and through this, a blessing to the Infinite.<br /><br />Perhaps we don't have ten minutes?  OK, five.  Not even five?  OK, one.<br /><br />Enjoy your minute.<br /><br />Be well.<br /><br />references:<br /><br />Rabbi Schachter-Shalomi, First Steps to a New Jewish Spirit<br />Master Dogen, Uji, in the Shobogenzo<br />Jon Kabot-Zinn, Wherever You Go, There You Are
