With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />There are some moments we would wish lasted forever. A grandchild's smile, the delight in our partner's eyes, or just a soothing moment in quiet peace. Yet, as we know, nothing lasts forever and our desire to hold on to moments does, indeed, produce suffering. So, what are we to do? <br /><br />Relax. Have faith. Moments, while moments, are always moments. Life has a way, when we are open and accepting, to offer us moment after moment of wonder and delight. By setting aside our need to control a moment or have a certain kind of moment, we surrender to the actual moment, as it is.<br /><br />These are the most delicious of moments as they are often completely unexpected.<br /><br />Let yourself be surprised by your life.<br /><br />Be well.
