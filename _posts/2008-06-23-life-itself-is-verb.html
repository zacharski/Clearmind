With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />When we say, "Just this!" we point to the field of deep interdependence and oneness.  Just this, the moment we see clearly, the moment the point is understood as both one and many, where near and far, birth and death, fall away, is also the moment to get off our butts and do something.<br /><br />Awakening is just to open one's eyes; living is to be alive with those eyes open.<br /><br />As living beings awake to the true nature of reality, we see what is to be done and we do it.  There is no real room for should, would, or could. Oneness is seamless. No subject; no object: life itself is the verb.<br /><br />If we want to live in peace, we just live in peace.  Inner and outer are one.  No separation.  Separation is illusion. A mind at peace with doing is at peace, period.<br /><br />One might say, but what if killing needs to be done?  What if people are causing harm?  An awakened person addresses such people with compassion, understanding such people are acting out of an interest to be free from suffering.  They are taking short-cuts and creating suffering in the process.  We model a peaceful, non-violent, and compassionate way. We know that as we are non-violent, the world is offered the gift of non-violence. It is very important to take a long view of this. In the short term many non-violent people may suffer at the hands of violent folk, but we see a trend, an evolution of sensibility and ethics, if you will, that points in the direction of enlightened living.<br /><br />While we know something may be harmful, we may not yet be ready to stop doing it...but we do know better!  This knowing is a seed that can be watered.  As a global human culture, we are moving quickly together...some, especially the fundamentalist and conservative,  kicking and screaming, into a progressive future, but we are evolving.<br /><br />Be well.
