With palms together,<br />Good Afternoon Everyone,<br /><br />This morning we clicked on Robbie the Robot to sweep the floors. As Robbie was doing his (or is it, her(?) thing, I went down to the hundred year dam and did a speed workout through the grove beside it.  Ended up doing two miles with 4 x 0.10 mile repeats.  We then went to the audiologist and My Little Honey was fitted with new hearing aids!  She now notices every sound including our kiss (she just left to have lunch with the ladies).<br /><br />I am busily preparing for our Temple book club this Sunday.  It is my turn to lead the discussion and I selected a book by Rabbi Karyn Kedar entitled, God Whispers: stories of the soul, lessons of the heart.  The book is a collection of her reflections as a rabbi working with people.  Its the sort of thing I write, actually.  Stories of real life used as lessons for myself and perhaps others.<br /><br />Writing is a great way to clarify.  The act of putting words on paper...or in this case, a computer screen...is an act of simultaneous creation and organization.  One must put thoughts together so they make sense and at the same time are both interesting and challenging for the reader.  I sometimes wonder if I ever make sense.  Maybe making sense is not optimal, I don't know.  Rabbi Kedar suggests at one point that we must "expand our boundaries".  By this she means we should not let artificial limits cut off our choices.  I thought of comedian George Carlin as I re-read through that section recently. Carlin had a way of seeing outside the box that made the box itself an exemplar of our limits. He used this skill to great advantage as he just went right through the limits.<br /><br />However, we cannot always do this and pushing limits must be intelligent and purposeful.  Too often people act out just because they can, setting aside the question of whether they should or not.  Not good enough.  Civilization suffers.  Still, we must get out of our habits of thinking, feeling, and seeing, as only then are truly new possibilities open to us.<br /><br /><br />Well, I now have to clean the bamboo flooring with wood cleaner...an easy job, and then get back to my book.<br /><br />Be well.
