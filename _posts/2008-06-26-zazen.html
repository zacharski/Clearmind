With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />On the Zen list there has been some discussion of sitting and stretches for sitting.  For those of you who have access to Three Pillars of Zen, please consult the excellent advice in the back of the book.  Posture, whether seated in a chair or on a cushion is critical.  Some, oddly enough, such as the unorthodox Brad Warner, are strong proponents of the full lotus. Others argue that any position is OK as long as the back is upright.  Still others, Jon Kabat-Zinn comes to mind, suggest that any comfortable position, including lying down, is good.<br /><br />I do not favor the notion that position should be comfortable.  Our purpose at Zazen is not to be comfortable, not to "zone out", go to some altered state of consciousness, or any other pleasant place. Our aim to to be awake, not feeling good.  The lotus and half lotus position offers tremendous stability; the cushion offers the proper cant to the hips so that our knees are thrust down as our bellies are extended out and our backs arched so that our shoulders are open and we can breathe freely.<br /><br />If using a chair, and most of my hitbodedut (Jewish meditation) students use chairs at the synagogue, we should try to sit on the forward third of the seat with our backs NOT resting. Knees should be shoulder width apart and feet planted solidly on the floor.  The feeling should be one of stability: we sit like a mountain.<br /><br />Our aim is to be fully and completely present without engaging any thing, any thought, any feeling, any noise, or any smell. We notice and return to our breath. Nothing more; nothing added.<br /><br />I cannot stress enough the importance of daily zazen practice.  It is eternal life.<br /><br />Be well.
