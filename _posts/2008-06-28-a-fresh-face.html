With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />There is a sense of history being made, a turning of a corner in the United States with this election.  Senator Obama's youthful, happy face and focus on change, the vibrant primaries with a very strong, very smart woman who ran a terrific campaign for the nomination for president, and on the other side a tired old man treading over the same old stories, supporting the same old industries, big businesses, and wars. In a word, its unsettling.<br /><br />I like Senator McCain.  I think he is a man of character.  He fought for his country when many chose not to, was a prisoner of war for years, and yet had the willingness and fortitude to work with his previous captors to bring an end to hostilities post Vietnam War. Like John Kerry, he chose a career in politics to give something back to his country.  Both men have been maligned in their careers by political opportunists and operatives.<br /><br />Yet, here's the thing.  Senator McCain is not the man of the hour. This is not his decade.  He's in the wrong party, fighting for the wrong side of causes, and in nearly every photo opportunity, he appears tired.<br /><br />We need a fresh face in America.  Nearly eight years of idiocy, abysmal foreign policy, and a trashing of our constitution to address political agendas have wounded us deeply.  Our economy is in the trash can, our housing market through deregulated craziness and market greed, is threatening to destroy the American dream, and oil...well just fill up that SUV and feel the hit on your overused plastic.  We need a fresh face in America. <br /><br />The religious and spiritually inclined people of the United States have, according to a recent Pew poll, a sense of openness and mutual respect of other religions...with a few exceptions. We must see past the abuses of the religious right to honor each of us as children of God, whether that God is Adonai, Allah, Jesus, or simply, the Infinite.<br /><br />Moreover, we the religious and spiritually inclined people of the United States have an obligation to bring about social change for the good of all.  As religious people our focus is always on the greater good of the community.  We address the social ills, the inequities, and the disgraces of greed, illness, war,  and other forms of violence. We must focus on what brings us together as human beings rather than on the insidious issues that break us apart.<br /><br />It is time to engage our communities in ways we have not been willing to do.  We need to hold ourselves responsible and accountable for the mess we are in and, as a result, build a better world.<br /><br />Be well.
