With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />This morning I plan to meet my son in Old Mesilla for a bike ride.  I have taken the last four days off from exercise in order to recover from a tweak in a hip muscle and an inflammation of my skin disorder (chronic folliculitis).  I took a Zyrtec to relieve the terrible itching and it pretty much knocked me out for two days.  Now the Zyrtec has worn off, I have some energy, and the itch is steadily returning. <br /><br />I often sit with this itch.  I watch it as what feels like pins stick my skin and remain there for awhile. I watch my response.  Most of the time I float with it.  When I am not mindfull, however, yikes, I scratch it...not good.  Like a lion the thing roars. More follicles get inflamed and I am desperately searching for something to calm it down. These things used to be on my neck.  I now have some on my forearm. They seem to be getting better overall.  Fewer follicles are subject. But those two or three...goodness.<br /><br />I sometimes am able to be thankful for them.  Like sometimes I'm thankful that My Left Foot is what it is.  This thankfulness is about appreciating being called to the present moment. Its a deliberate effort to come into alignment. Nothing wakes someone up like stumbling in front of people or having a flame war going on on your skin. Its when I start feeling sorry for myself that things go downhill. <br /><br />We each have our issues, don't we?  Some of us are in wheelchairs.  Some have visual impairments.  Some have hearing loss.  Some are lost in nostalgia and fearful of the next day.  What matters most, in my opinion, isn't the issues.  Issues are part of the human condition.  What matters most is our attitude toward them. <br /><br />When we deal with issues directly, no problem. If my arm itches, it is my wishing it wouldn't itch, that's the real problem.  That desire to be free from suffering causes the scratching, the medication taking, and the emotional irritation. When I am mindful, noticing the pins,  I just wash the affected area, put something on it, place my attention back on my breath or whatever activity I was involved in, and the itch loses its power. This is Zen practice.<br /><br />Zen practice is internal. It is how we orient our minds, hearts, and bodies to be in our environment as one.<br />     Be well.
