With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />There are sixteen vows to being a Zen Buddhist.  They are: Vow to take Refuge in the Buddha, Vow to take Refuge in the Dharma, Vow to take Refuge in the Sangha. Vow to Cease Doing Evil, Vow to Do Good, Vow to Bring About Good for all Beings, Vow not to kill, Vow not to steal, Vow not to misuse sex, Vow not to lie, Vow not to intoxicate the mind, Vow not to gossip, Vow not to elevate oneself at the expense of others, Vow not to be greedy, especially with the Dharma, Vow not to indulge in anger, Vow not to speak ill of the Three Treasures.<br /><br />It is important to note that these vows are both positive and negative.  We must not only vow to not kill, but also affirm life, for example.  A religious life is not simply rule based, however.  A religious life is a life devoted to being awake. From a Big Mind perspective, what is killing?  What is supporting life?  This planet is but an infinitesimal speck in an expanding, boundless universe. There is no number for the number of planets, stars, and celestial material.  As Dr. Carl Sagan pointed out in his Varieties of Scientific Experience  religion to be worth its salt must account for this vastness and the essentially small part of the vast universe we occupy. <br /><br />Solar systems and galaxies are constantly being born and dying; just as the complex human body is born and dies.  Yet, we say, in Zen, there is no birth and death.  We say this because we often speak from Big Mind, the mind of the Infinite.<br /><br />So, we accept life and death are both cycles, like the in-breath and the out-breath, but that the names we give them are not them, themselves.  Living and dying are ultimately processes of eternal life, eternal life on a vastness of scale we cannot imagine.  So, how do we reconcile the particular?  If death is a part of life, just this, then why not die, kill, or otherwise not worry about it? <br /><br />This is a koan for each of us.<br /><br />Be well.
