With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />I just read a study at livescience.com which reported that happiness in the world in increasing.  The happiest, Denmark.  The unhappiest, Zimbabwe.  The United States ranks 16th. <br /><br />The researcher, Ronald Inglehart of  The University of Michigan, says, "The results clearly show that the happiest societies are those that allow people the freedom to choose how to live their lives." <br /><br />In a survey released last week, pointed to one reason the US is not closer to the top:  Baby Boomers are <a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/livescience/sc_livescience/storytext/studyworldgetshappier/28072036/SIG=11s6clkbh/*http://www.livescience.com/health/080625-baby-boomers.html">generally miserable</a> compared to other generations.<br /><br />The livescience articles adds, "Further, a public opinion poll released by the Pew Research Center in April found that 81 percent of Americans say they believe the country is on the "wrong track." The response is the most negative in the 25 years pollsters have asked the question."<br /><br /><a href="http://www.livescience.com/health/080630-world-happiness.html">Link</a><br /><br />Maybe we are finally getting the point that an open society is a living, dynamic, and happy thing.  Efforts to make people follow this or that path are just efforts to close a system.  We all know what happens to closed systems, don't we?  They die.<br /><br />Be well.
