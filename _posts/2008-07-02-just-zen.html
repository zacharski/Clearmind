With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />The sun rises over the mountains in Las Cruces, New Mexico.  I often sit with it as it does. Its a marvelous transformation of night into day, sleep to awake, and stillness to motion. We appreciate both the stillness and the motion. Eventually we come to realize they are one.<br /><br />The Zen of stillness is the Zen of being seated while the world swirls around us.  The Zen of motion is the Zen of being the world swirling. Awake we know there is just Zen.<br /><br />Be well.
