With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />We so often look for wonder in the big places, the edge of the Grand Canyon, some mountain peak, the completion of a grand dream like running a marathon, and while these are wondrous to be sure, to seek wonder solely in them often blinds us to the wonder in the ordinary. We often here people say, 'what's so special' about this or that. We hear people talk with dreamy eyes about planned adventures, sometimes to exotic places, and I feel good for them, but at the same time, sad.<br /><br />Each and every day has its wonder.  We wake in the morning to see a sun rise.  We see the darkness turn to light.  We hear the world wake up.  My Little Honey brings me a cup of coffee.  It tastes really good. I watch Tripper as he dances in dogged excitement waiting for his turn to go outside and smell the world. Ordinary wonders.<br /><br />As we sit in the stillness of Zazen, we begin to notice the details of the moment.  These details are often obscured in everyday life by the sheer volume and variety of activity in our lives.  How does my back feel just here, or my toes feel as they begin to go to sleep ten minutes into Zazen?  How do I witness my response to thoughts or feelings as I sit without physical response, except to return to my breath? We might hear a clock tick or the air flow through the ducts in our building. On one level, the wonders of life go on with or without our involvement.<br /><br />Yet it is equally true that there is no wonder in life without us.  In a sense, we add wonder to our experience. And therein lies the problem: we become addicts.  What we need isn't so much wonder, big or small, but rather, appreciation.  Our practice isn't the seeking of wonder, but appreciating the actual moment. No special trips necessary.<br /><br />When we appreciate, deeply appreciate, each moment, a moment becomes eternal.<br /><br />Be well.
