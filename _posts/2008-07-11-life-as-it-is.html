With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />To practice Zazen is to practice enlightenment itself. We take our seat with complete deliberation.   We sit down, gather ourselves together, assume he cosmic mudra and remain present. This being upright, being present, is the heart of practice.  It is life itself. In this practice there is no reliance on anything but your own willingness to stay in the moment. No text, no sutra, no mantra, no mandala: just this: life as it is.<br /><br />In this presence, everything opens.  The mind is not processing, appearance comes and goes.  Sounds come and go, as do feelings and all other senses.  Nothing gets stuck, everything flows.<br /><br />When we look back on this experience we see its cosmic implication. If we are willing to set aside the "I", life itself  can be seen clearly for what it is, a continuous, unfolding process. Our "I" is like a dam constructed to halt the flow. We want to keep this slice of the process, this life as it is.  But stopping the process is impossible and our thoughts that we can an illusion. <br /><br />Practicing Zazen teaches us to let go.<br /><br />What enters when everything opens?  Life itself.  The Infinite.  And in this moment we see how naming is counter-productive, even futile. The Infinite, the Absolute, Jesus, Allah, Big Mind...all are weak constructs that when used close us off to the actuality of experience.  Buddhists try to avoid discussions of what this is. Jews rely on no-name names like "Ha Shem" (the name) to point without describing. Both focus on practice rather than belief<br /><br />We are left with practice.<br /><br />I invite each of you to take up this practice regardless of your religion. Zazen will not only deepen your relationship to the universe, but open your heart to it.  <br />Be well.
