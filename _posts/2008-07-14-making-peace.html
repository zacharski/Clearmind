With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br />This week I go to Peace Camp each morning to conduct a morning meditation with the children attending. I am looking forward to this.  It is a delight to sit with children. They are always fresh and interested in something new.  Peace Camp is hosted by the Unitarian Universalist Church here in Las Cruces, but is supported by several other churches, the synagogue, and Clear Mind Zen Sangha, as well as many local organizations and businesses. <br /><br />So, we will sit in the sanctuary and be still.  Starting the day with attention to our breath. We will make a vow to bring peace into the universe by making ourselves the very peace we desire.<br /><br />I encourage each of you to sit in peace this morning then to get up from your cushions and make peace in the world.<br /><br />Be well.
