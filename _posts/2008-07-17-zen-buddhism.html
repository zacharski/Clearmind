With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Zen Buddhism is the practice of the Middle Way.  A way between extremes, the practice informs us, teaches us, and frees us from greed, hatred and delusion. It is, and isn't, a religion, a philosophy, a way of life. Its a way of being in the world.<br /><br />We practice Zen Buddhism in order to be at peace.  We practice Zen Buddhism to be present.  We practice Zen Buddhism to live.<br /><br />What do Zen Buddhists believe? Whatever they want.  Zen Buddhism is not about belief or worldview or cosmic conflict: its about residing in peace.<br /><br />Are there articles of faith?  No.  There are instead principles of practice.  The focus is on experiencing the truth of your life as it is in this moment.<br /><br />Zen Buddhism does not focus on the past or the future.<br /><br />The principles of practice are simple. On the interior, be stillness.  On the exterior, stop doing evil, do good, and work to bring about good for all. How hard is that?<br /><br />Be well.
