With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />This week I go to Peace Village again to offer meditation instruction and practice to the younger children.  I have found that young children can practice Zazen very well for short periods. They have open minds and are willing to learn. This openness is key.  It is awareness itself.  To be open with no closed openings is to allow everything to flow. One of the principles of Zen is open-mindedness.<br /><br />A second principle is the principle of moving from inside out. We begin our practice, that is, come to Zen, with an interest in ourselves.  We wish to improve, remove an obstacle, solve a problem, find happiness. As we develop our practice we discover our deep interconnected nature, we release our interest in ourselves and open ourselves to an interest in others. We come to an awareness, a recognition, that we and others are actually one.  Taking care of ourselves is taking care of others: taking care of others is taking care of ourselves. The universe is our home and we are our universe.<br /><br />The third principle, then, is the principle of deep caring. Deep caring is based in an opening that allows our compassionate heart to emerge and guide us through our daily activity.  This compassionate heart is our Buddha-nature.  Tenderness, love, a willingness to listen: these arise from our Buddha-nature.  Zazen puts us in touch with these.  Mindful practice allows us to touch these.  <br /><br />May you each be a blessing in the universe today.
