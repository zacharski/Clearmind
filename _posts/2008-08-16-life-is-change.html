With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Our living room is looking very strange.  Paintings that once adorned the walls are stacked now against them, boxes are stacked with markers telling us to what part of our house they belong. The kitchen has been packed.  The library has been packed. The bathrooms have been packed. We are left with the odds and ends necessary to continue to live in this condo until Tuesday when son Jason arrives to move in.  Over this weekend we hope to move the boxes and the furniture to the garage, then on Monday we will thoroughly clean the place.<br /><br /> Our new house will not be ready for a few weeks yet. So we will be living in Jacob's apartment in Old Mesilla for that time.  The house is looking good, though.  The stucco is done.  The tile floors are pretty much done.  The kitchen cabinets are nearly finished.  The interior has been painted.  The fireplace is done. Still to do: the rest of the tile, the carpeting, the rest of the cabinets, the granite counter tops, and all the plumbing fixtures. And lastly, the exterior tile, driveway, and partial landscaping.<br /><br />My hope is that this will be our last move.<br /><br />Living in the midst of transition points to the truth that nothing is certain and nothing lasts forever: we are always changing. Its just that the pace of the change is normally quite slow.  But life transitions like moving, marriage, divorce, these are in your face fast. Unmistakable. We see that what we thought of as solid is not really.  Its a facade we erect to create an illusion of stability.  We all "know" that life itself is change, but how often are we living its truth?<br /><br />Zen practice, the practice of serene reflection meditation, is a practice that considers change the very basis of life. We contemplate in stillness to realize there is no stillness, only to awaken in universal stillness. Its like finally realizing in Big Mind, there is no motion. Motion, itself, is a Small Mind phenomenon. <br /><br />The so what of this is a centered acceptance of life as it actually is, changing, evolving, deveploping. There is nothing to hold on to and no reason to hold on.<br /><br />Let go. Enjoy.<br /><br />Be well.
