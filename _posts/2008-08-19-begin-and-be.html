With palms together,<br />Good Afternoon All,<br /><br />The best way to begin a disciplined spiritual practice is to actually begin.  We can read about such practices all day and night, but until we actually begin, we are no where.  Of course, in a manner of speaking, there is no beginning and no end.  In truth we are all involved in a spiritual practice and will be until the day we die.  We may not be aware of it, we may not be very disciplined about it, but we are involved with every breath we take.<br /><br />Yet, a true, disciplined spiritual practice, a practice that opens one's heart to the Infinite, is a practice that requires a commitment and a practice.<br /><br />So, what does it mean to begin a disciplined spiritual practice?  It might mean setting a daily time for meditation.  This meditation might be seated or walking or even lying down.  It might mean deciding to light the sabbath candles at sunset on Fridays.  It might mean the we decide to recite the morning prayers from the siddur.  Or we could recite blessings through the day, taking note of all the wonder in our lives.  In the end, the commitment to a disciplined spiritual practice is a commitment to mindful living.<br /><br />As we sip our tea or coffee, we should take a breath and settle down enough to actually sip that beverage, experience it as if we've never tasted such a thing before. When we walk, we could deliberately slow the pace, feel our feet touch the floor or ground, sense its resistance to our weight. As we sit down we can  feel our body as it comes to rest,  filling the space of the chair or sofa.  Every moment in every place offers us an opportunity to be awake.<br />   It is our responsibility to be open to it.<br /><br />Be well
