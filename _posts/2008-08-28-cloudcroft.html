With palms together,<br />Good Afternoon All,<br /><br />The mountains are a delightful mix of sun and cloud with raindrops falling from time to time.  I have been steady at work on getting my book edited.  The process is, well, good practice. I am using one single year of my teishos from December to December and editing each of them.  They are from my great year of transitions from Zen Center to Clear Mind Zen to streetZen with a twist of Zen Judaism. As you each know by now, my teaching typically begins with a few details in my life and moves out from there.  I see this as an experiential application of Zen and an unfolding of my own story in the process. <br /><br />There will come a time when I will need to present to a publisher a market.  I was wondering if any of you could write a short note back to me as regards your willingness to purchase such a book.  You are, of course, NOT obligated.  But I will keep all such notes and use them to persuade a publisher that there might be a market for this book.<br /><br />As to my day to day:  I have taken on a monastic practice.  I get up early, practice zazen, prepare tea, clean, then work.  Afternoon practice period, lunch, clean, then work. I go to bed pretty much at sunset after evening zazen.  This is a good cycle for me. <br /><br />I look forward to hearing from you.<br /><br />And, of course, if you are in the neighborhood of the Refuge, please feel free to drop in!<br /><br />May you each be a blessing in the universe.
