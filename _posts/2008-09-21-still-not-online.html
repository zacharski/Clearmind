With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />We still have no Internet or telephone at the new house.  It seems that the house line is not connected to the rest of the world. I assume this is a temporary setback.  It took a lot of Zen to get through that setback. :)<br /><br />Anyway, I have a few changes to make to Clear Mind Zen's weekly schedule.<br /><br />First, the Zendo is open to my formal students only on a daily (M-F) basis at 5:30 AM to sit with me as we practice morning zazen.<br /><br />Second, I am changing  the public Thursday evening zazen practice period to Wednesday evening at 7:00 to 8:30 PM.<br /><br />Third, I will host a monthly half day Zazenkai on Saturday morning from 9:00 AM t 12:00 PM.  This will occur on the first Saturday of each month except those months involving sesshin.<br /><br />Please call the night before to let me know if you are coming to any of these opportunities to practice with me.  <br />I hope to be online at the beginning of the week sometime.  Until then, /\<br /><br />Be well.
