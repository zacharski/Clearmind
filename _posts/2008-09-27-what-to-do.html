With palms together,<br /><br /><br />Strong Zen:  we are now wireless and untethered from a hard-line to the laptops, but one of our phone jacks is inoperable.  Thank goodness for wireless, walkaround, phones.  So, our bedroom is a maze of wires and blinking lights, but I am able to sit at the desk in the living room and write to you.<br /><br />This was a several day, many continuous hour process. I am pleased that it is over, but also pleased that we managed to get through it with a minimum of serious stress.<br /><br />I look forward to getting back to short dialog and daily posts.<br /><br />I was studying koan case Number 36 in the Gateless Gate collection translated and commented upon by Senzaki roshi  outside on the patio this morning in the pre-dawn hours. The case is entitled, Meeting a Master on the Road.<br /><br />Gaso said,  "When you meet a Zen master on the road, you cannot say speak, you cannot remain silent.  What will you do?<br /><br />Dear Zen students, what is your answer?<br /><br />Be well.
