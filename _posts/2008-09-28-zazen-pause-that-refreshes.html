With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Ancient traditions have us practice zazen several times daily. I suppose the old ones, beggars that they were, had little else to do! Today we sit often zazen begrudgingly.  We feel as though we steal time from activities or loved ones in order to gather ourselves together in a Zendo just to be still.  So precious do we feel our actual presence in everything actually is!  Oy.<br /><br />So, sit zazen we must.  Learning to take the time to bring ourselves to a stillpoint, allowing the universe to continue without our hustle and bustle, is incredibly important. Such a stillpoint is the seat of the Infinite.  In this stillpoint we open like flowers and receive. It is very nurturing.<br /><br />Not only do we receive, but we offer, as well: we offer our peace, love, and compassion, all rolled up into one practice, the practice of zazen.<br /><br />In the quiet of the morning, it is good to sit zazen.  In the quiet of the late evening is a good time to practice zazen.   At odd times during the day, perhaps at your desk, in your sofa, at your kitchen counter: take just a few breaths with eyes half closed. This sort of thing is a real pause that refreshes.  As the pause brings us back to ourselves and our true nature.<br /><br />May you each be a blessing in the universe!<br /><br />A Good Week!
