With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />I woke a little late this morning, passing by my wrist alarm as if it were a pesky fly. So, zazen will come after this missive. It is Wednesday.  Today we sit at the peace vigil at 4:30 PM and again in the Zendo at 7:00 PM. For reasons I cannot recall other than the vague sense of family and moving issues, I have not been at the vigils for several weeks now.  So, I look forward to returning to this practice.  Especially now that the weather is not quite as hot.  Besides, this is a new year for me and an opportunity to re-commit to peace action.<br /><br />Peace is a tricky thing.  Peace activists cover the waterfront from complete pacifists to those who are simply opposed to this war (the one in Iraq).  Some Zen Masters might say we can be at complete peace while swiftly cutting the head off an opponent. Most others might say, surrender all violence and consider all alternatives to violent action in the cause of peace.  I am somewhere in there.  To not kill also means to support and defend life.<br /><br />We must understand that there are those who do not believe in peace or hold it in esteem as a virtue.  These are dangerous people who do not value life for itself but only life in service to a belief system, a state, or a practice. It makes no sense to surrender one's life to them in the cause of peace.  On the other hand, it does not make sense to kill them either or celebrate their deaths.<br /><br />We should strive to find a middle way, a path between violent action and complete surrender. A commitment to peace is a commitment to life itself.  Let this be a guiding principle.<br /><br />Be well.
