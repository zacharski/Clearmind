With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Clearly fall is upon us here in southern New Mexico.  The early morning sky was seriously overcast as the mountains were nearly hidden in them.  Lightning flashed in the pre-dawn.  It has rained a coldish, miserable sort of rain and much of the landscape has that gray look that always seems to accompany a seasonal temperature drop.<br /><br />I stood outside by the rock wall cleaning i-robot of this morning gatherings of dust and dog hair. It was pretty wet and nippy. Marvelous light on majestic mountains was my backdrop.  Robot is recharging now and I am enjoying a little coffee.  Zazen went well, if not a tad droopy.  Of late, I seem to have little energy.<br /><br />Here's the thing: such things come and go and I firmly believe they are tightly connected to our inner self.  When we are purposeful, we feel better; when we are in motion, we feel better.  The key is to have an aim and be in motion at the same time while then re-enforce the positive thoughts and feelings as they naturally arise in the process.<br /><br />Today is a good day to begin.  Its the beginning of a new week, I teach my last Jewish Spirituality class for this session, and the clouds are supposed to break in the afternoon. <br /><br />"For you see,<br />We are the result of the desire of awareness,<br />And the prayer of the Creator,<br />To comprehend itself."<br />Rabbi Lawrence Kushner
