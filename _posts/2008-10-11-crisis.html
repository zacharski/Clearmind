With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />Nothing is forever.  Oh, how we resist this simple truth!  Beaches erode, we attempt to shore them up; age takes its toll, we attempt to repair or prevent it; our economy goes to the dogs and, yes, we try to buttress it, prevent the loss of our fortunes.  Everything changes: its the nature of the universe.<br /><br />Yet, our safety is threatened.  Our comfort and security is in question, not in some far off desert, but right here on Main Street.<br /><br />What to do.<br /><br />A few months ago I was threatened with a serious reduction in my pension.  I freaked. We were in the process of our credit review and the closing processes on our new house.  My mind was not as elastic as I had hoped.<br /><br />What I did:  I saw my psychiatrist; I took time to sleep, to practice meditation, but I also took the time to engage the VA and the DAV. I was committed to health regardless of outcome.<br /><br />Zazen helps us see clearly that life is a full process of birth and death...to the point that we see there is no real birth or death, just universal process. In this we come to relax a bit.  Life goes on.  We really have all that we need.  Like trauma teaches, we learn to value this moment itself regardless of its particular flavor.<br /><br />Counseling helps us as we begin to sort and organize: we develop priorities, we learn to respond appropriately.<br /><br />Engaging the problem directly, with as little emotional tidal wave behind us as possible, is also wise.  We must assume responsibility for our priorities, our decisions, and the consequences of those decisions.<br /><br />Lastly, we must be willing to teach ourselves to let go of that we cannot change.  We cannot be responsible as individuals for the world and the world's economy.  We can only do what we can do on our own level, then let the rest go. <br /><br />So difficult.  We are addicted to news, to up to the millisecond computer reports, and a thought that if we are only fast enough and wise enough,  we can save ourselves.  Perhaps.<br /><br />The greater truth is that we are not our wealth or our possessions; we are not our status in the world or the power of our armies. We are just people, little buddhas, who need to awaken.<br /><br />Practice mindful attention, practice zazen, practice life.
