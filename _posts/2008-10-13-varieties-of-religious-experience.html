With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Last night we had Sunday dinner with our son, Jason, his wife Maggie, and our granddaughter, Olivia.  Sunday dinner is a family tradition that began when our children moved out of the house after high school. They were invited to come to dinner on Sunday and could bring friends with adequate notice. Over time we amassed a few ex-girlfriends and an occasional ex-boyfriend, who would continue to visit even after they were "ex's".  Our dinners were always open and inviting and we truly appreciated getting to know the people in our children's lives. Now that we have children once again in the neighborhood, we are delighted to continue this tradition.  <br /><br /><br />Anyway, last night Olivia discovered the Zendo.  At three years old, she was quite impressed with its emptiness.  The gong and small bell delighted her, the mokugyo made her stop and take notice with its deep, wooden sound.  I taught her to sit, gassho, and bow. But most of all we enjoyed the sounds of the instruments of Zen.  Earlier in the day, Olivia attended our Temple's "Training Wheels" program, a sort of early preschool program to get children and parents ready for the Religious School. This is a true variety of religious experience.  I wonder what William James would have thought of this.<br /><br />In truth, the Infinite lives in every experience.<br /><br />Be well,
