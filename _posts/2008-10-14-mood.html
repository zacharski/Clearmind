With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Feeling good about the market rebound yesterday, I cautioned myself.  It is important not to let our emotions determine our mood.  What?  Our emotions are our mood, you say.  Not so.<br /><br />Our mood may be a reflection of our emotional state, but our mood, it seems to me, is much more complex than that.  Mood and attitude: our stance with regard to ourselves and our world is an aggregate of thought, feeling, behavior, and core beliefs. Our mood, then, is a dynamic reflection of our core beliefs, our core selves.<br /><br />Mood.  I really do not like that word so much. I prefer not to be in a mood or moody.  I prefer to be present. If I am happy, I am happy; if angry, angry.  An overflow of feeling into mood is not comfortable, nor is it good for us.<br /><br />One of the best ways to make our mood stable is to recognize that thoughts and feelings are not us; they are transient reflections of our core beliefs. Our brains produce thoughts, we respond with feelings, and the whole complex filters through our core beliefs.  I am of the opinion, that our core beliefs can be changed, can be "watered" as Thich Nhat Hahn points out and grown into magnificent flowers of loving-kindness, balance, and beauty, thus allowing us to be at peace even in the midst of unhappy circumstances.<br /><br />When we practice to nurture the seeds of compassion, we become compassionate.  When we water the seeds of loving-kindness, we become loving-kindness.  And when we water the seeds of equanimity and non-attachment, we become balance itself.<br /><br />The skeptics might say at this point, "No, actually, you become all wet!"  But in truth, we can never get enough nurturance.  We are social beings who grow through love.<br /><br />So, if I am not my mood, my thoughts, my feelings, or my core beliefs as these are in constant flux, then what am I?<br /><br /> Be well.
