With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Yesterday we spent the morning with friends at the hospital. Our friend, Ken Kessen, underwent another major oral surgery to remove areas of his mouth affected by cancer and other issues.  Please keep him and his wife, Deana, in your thoughts and prayers.<br /><br />Being with friends as they struggle is something we are becoming quite familiar with.  I think it is a sign of our particular age and place in the life-cycle.  I was talking with someone at Temple yesterday who is witnessing her parents age and deteriorate in these, their final years.  She said she wished God had set things up so that we live until we go out like sparklers.  I understand the sentiment. Some of us are for sure fortunate if we die in our sleep with little to no warning.  Yet, on the other hand, a process of dying has its advantages, as well.<br /><br />While I would not wish long periods of painful suffering on anyone, I do think, aging itself is a stage of life that can be useful to all. We learn so much from each other about the nature of life, about friendships and family, and about our relationship with our bodies. In essence, we have the opportunity to become sages.<br /><br />Events in our lives, painful events, can lead us to curse God and life itself.  We ask the eternal questions, all beginning with "why?!"  Yet, there are no answers really, at least none that are satisfying.  It is in our nature, though, to ask.  We want to make sense of our experiences.  Yet, the sense we can make is limited to our tools, our senses, our brain, etc. Some things are just out of their scope.<br /><br />When we encounter such things, it is best, in my opinion, to see them for what they are, processes of life, rather than part of some plan of an Infinite being.  When we experience without judging the experience, knowing all experience is passing, I think we can more easily attend to the experience itself. Attending to experience is the essence of life. That, friends, may be its true meaning: it is the essence of being a sage.<br /><br />May we all be free from suffering,
