With Palms Together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Our weekend went well in the mountains.  As we arrived there was a person there looking at the property.  The refuge is still for sale, technically, as there is a real estate contract in place, but we will only accept a very good (close to asking price) offer for the place and I would have many regrets selling it.  On the other hand, it does require a degree of work we are no longer able to commit to (or do) on a regular basis.  Its nearly six acres of fenced forest with a meadow, a wood burning cook stove requiring chopped wood, and water to be pumped from holding  or collection tanks to the gravity feed tank on the ridge behind the house.  The vegetation nearly took over the place this summer.  I am anticipating fence repair as trees inevitably fall across fences in the winter.  This means getting out the chain saw. Goodness.<br /><br />On the upside, son Jason and daughter-in-law Maggie did a great job doing much of the work.  Jason got the 4 wheeler going and used it to flatten out much of the rampaging Russian thistle.  He then got out the scythe and began swinging it. Maggie and Jason both chopped wood.  Maggie and I rolled some cut rounds down off the ridge that Ken Roshi had cut a couple of years ago to age.  <br /><br />We did lots of laundry. Judy cooked.  Olivia played and played.  She is one fearless and rambunctious 3 year old.<br /><br />In between I had time to do sitting-in-the-recliner meditation. Every once in a while I would light a stick of incense, bow, and sit unobtrusively in the recliner and settle my attention. Occasionally, this would result in a nap.<br /><br />At the conclusion of the visit, Maggie, Olivia and Judy left very early.  Jason packed up and winterized; I cleaned the house, mopped, and polished the floors. He loaded up the ATV on a trailer (he wants to do some work on it here in Cruces and (of course) ride it in the desert) and we drove down off the mountain and across the desert.<br /><br />Last night we practiced meditation at Temple Beth El.  It is a smaller and smaller group. I am considering ending it so that I can free up Monday evening for regular Zen Meditation at Clear Mind Zendo. What do you think?<br /><br />Be well.
