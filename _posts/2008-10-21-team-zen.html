Good Morning Again,<br /><br />A Team Zen Update:  This morning I did a hard hill repeat  workout (8 repeats) in the desert on sandy trails and steep hills. I completed 1.75 miles in total.    My modest training schedule is as follows:  Sunday, long run; Monday easy walk; Tuesday, desert hill repeats with a trail run base; Wednesday, easy walk; Thursday, interval run; Friday, easy walk; Saturday, off.<br /><br />Shortly I will add a little biking, easy kick boxing, and some free weight training again, but I need to get a base established first. (Our garage is almost ready to act as a gym.)<br /><br />I plan to increase my distance, repeat numbers, and interval numbers by 10% or so weekly, with the goal of completing the 15 mile portion of the Bataan Death March in March 2009.<br /><br />For those of you who don't know, we had a "Team Zen" at the Zen Center for a couple of years and did local races.  We made t-shirts that had "Stillness in Motion" printed on the backs. It was a lot of fun.<br /><br />Fitness Training is an excellent Zen practice as it requires focused attention in repetition.  The practitioner places his/her complete attention on the body and breath, integrating that with the physical environment while in motion.  Some, while doing long distance running, get a sense of "zoning out"  which is not exactly a good thing, nor is it good Zen.  Zen training, whether seated Zen or Zen in motion, requires moment-to-moment attention.  It is not about an altered state, but about waking up and being present.<br /><br />I would be interested in hearing about your training.  Maybe we can reestablish a team and find a race in the future to do together.<br /><br />Be well.
