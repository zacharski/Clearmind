With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />This morning was a chilly 45 degrees according to my thermometer as we headed out the door to meet friends Eve and Allen for a brisk morning walk.  Actually, I needed less brisk, but then there was a morning breeze with that chilled air, so we naturally had a quick pace. Somewhere along the way I asked Allen to slow down.  It was a rest/easy walk day for me.<br /><br />In practice it is important to know the aim of your practice.  Its part of the discipline.  This is the meaning of that old saying, "When sitting, sit; when walking, walk: above all don't wobble". We do not sit zazen then in the middle of a sitting period decide to begin chanting practice.  Likewise, if running a long, slow run, we don't in the middle decide to do speed repeats.  Each practice has its place and its purpose.<br /><br />Many of us are impatient, however, and think more is better. In training this leads to injury or burnout.  In Zen practice, the same:  we become so goal focused that we are caught in the goal.  Like tugging on a Chinese puzzle, the harder we try to get free, the tighter the weave holds us in place.  Relax and we are free.<br /><br />Be well.
