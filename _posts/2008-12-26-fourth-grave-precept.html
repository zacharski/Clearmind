With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />The Fourth Grave Precept is: Do not lie.<br /><br />This precept, like all the others,is geared toward what makes for a civilized world.  One of the foundations of civil society is trust. In order for us to function together we must trust that what is said to us is honest.  Lying about, distorting, and otherwise "handling": the truth erodes this trust.<br /><br />Yet, we have a similar paradox as with other precepts.  What is the truth?  Truth is subjective.  It is perception and perception can (and is) distorted by experience. so, if we have been robbed by people of a certain background, we may perceive people from that background to be "suspect" when in fact, they are not.<br /><br />Better then, that we focus our attention on our own speech.  We should speak only honestly with right thought and right understanding. We should not try to deceive.<br /><br />Yet, always we should have in mind the maxim, 'do no harm'.   Sometimes telling the truth can be harmful, such as telling an angry person with a gun who is chasing another person which way that person fled. Sometimes remaining silent is the best practice.<br /><br />It turns out that precepts are not as easy as one, two, three.<br /><br />Be well.
