With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />This morning we explore the Second Grave Precept: Do Not Steal. To accept what is not given speaks to a breakdown in social and personal boundaries.  It suggests a profound disrespect for the property rights of others. But more than that, it points to our own greed.<br /><br />Stealing takes so many forms it is easy to violate this precept without care. Accepting more change than you are entitled to at a cash register for example.  Accepting a mistake on the sale price of an item at the department store, for another example.  These are forms of stealing. One does not have to hold someone up or slip something into one's pocket in order to be a thief.<br /><br />This precept asks us to be diligent  in our dealings with people, things, and money.  A borrowed, but never returned book, for example is a kind of stealing.  Loans are time-limited. And so on.  So, it is our responsibility to do our own due diligence in returning things borrowed in a timely manner.<br /><br />It would seem of late that our society is leaning toward gain regardless of the ethics involved as a base value. When we commit to a disciplined spiritual path, this can no longer be the case. <br /><br />May you be a blessing in the universe.
