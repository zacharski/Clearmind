With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />This morning we address the Third Grave Precept: Do not commit sexual misconduct. This precepts points directly at us and our society.  We reflect ourselves in our art forms, if we can call them that: Desperate Housewives, The L Word, Californication...even Boston Legal.  So much television is devoted to attracting viewers through sexual content that it is nearly impossible to turn the box on without seeing one seductive Victoria's Secret woman or a Hanes commercial, etc., etc.  Then we are to walk away and keep our eyes to ourselves...whoops did you see that woman wearing nothing but lingerie at K-Mart?  Or how about yesterday when a lady wearing pajamas walked past me in Wal-Mart.  Eyes in head, head straight. <br /><br />Sexual misconduct is all in the mind. Its also all about relationships. Its about health.  Its about trust.  Its about caring.  Its about loving.  Its about everything that is so challenging in our culture.<br /><br />Another way to frame this precept is:  I vow to use my sexuality to nurture and enhance my life and the lives of others.<br /><br />We use this version in many of our Jukai Ceremonies. It places sexuality in a positive light and asks us to be positive about it. It also takes it somewhat out of the prurient mode and into the mode of healthy living.<br /><br />To view sexuality in this way makes the steamy sort of understanding put forth in the media in a unhealthy light.  Sex is not about self fulfilment; its about nurturance of others.<br /><br />Just like any other aspect of humanity we can use it toward an evil end or a good end:  the choice is always ours.  What is important to remember, in my opinion, is that it is not the tool that is the "problem", but how and to what end that tool is used.<br /><br />Be wise.
