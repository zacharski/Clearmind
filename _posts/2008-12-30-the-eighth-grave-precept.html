The Eighth Grave Precept<br /><br />The Eighth Grave Precept is: Do not be stingy with the Dharma or property. In my Order we use: I will be generous with what I possess. Other translations are much simpler, "I vow not to be greedy."<br /><br />Another koan: how can we be greedy with what we possess when, in truth, we can possess nothing?<br /><br />This precept, like all of them, can be read at least in two levels: the ordinary and the extraordinary, with Small Mind or with Big Mind.<br /><br />On the Small Mind level we are talking about actually sharing what we hold in our hands, our houses, our banks, and our heart/minds. As we realize aspects of the Dharma, we should share when asked or when needed.<br /><br />On a Big Mind level, we realize there is nothing that we can possess, so we have nothing to offer, but more, nothing is needed. All is perfect just as it is. We just are not able or willing to perceive this and let it rise up.<br /><br />A harmful thing happens, we engage it without attachment or emotional investment and make it better. This is the Bodhisattva Way. Our way is to bring harmony into being.<br /><br />The deluded mind sees property as a possession, something one can hold onto forever. Greed has taken over much of our country: finance, mortgage, Wall Street, all manner of business. Profit is all. (Please, I grant there are some companies, etc., that do not behave poorly.) In such an atmosphere everyone is vulnerable, trust is eroded, civil society is threatened. This is why greed is considered one of the Three Poisons.<br /><br />The antidote to greed is generosity. If we catch ourselves being greedy, we should automatically give. Better to give in error than build and maintain a greedy heart.<br /><br />Its all practice.<br /><br />Be well,
