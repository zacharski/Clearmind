With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />It is often said the mind is buddha.  In such a case we might write as, "The Mind is Buddha" meaning the universal mind.  It also means the mind is awake, sentient, conscious.<br /><br />Zen Master Seung Sahn has a few phrases he repeatedly uses.  They form a poem:<br /><br />Unmoving Mind<br />What's this?<br />Who am I?<br />Just don't know!<br />Only go straight!<br /><br /><br />Each of these lines is a sort of koan.  Please study them.  Keep them between your eyes. Put them on your refrigerator, on your bathroom mirror, on the dashboard of your car.<br /><br />Answer with authenticity. Live with authenticity. <br /><br />Last night we had granddaughter Livvie and son Jason visit for dinner.  Daughter-in-law Maggie was working.  After dinner as I was preparing to exclude myself, a few comments were made at my expense. I, it seems, have the reputation of always having "the last word" and they set out to prove it.  As I caught on to this, I smiled.  Authenticity can be revealing.<br /><br />In trying we fail; we must just do.<br /><br />Be well.
