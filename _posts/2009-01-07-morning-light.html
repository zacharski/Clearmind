With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />This morning's air is a cold 25 degrees. I am looking forward to sitting with the sun as it rises and gently lights the zendo and warms the desert air. I woke at 5:08 AM this morning.  Waking early is a marvelous thing, but does create issues in the evening.  I am typically in bed by 8:00 PM and often asleep soon after.<br /><br />Mornings are a magical time in my view.  Everything seems fresh and opportune. The colors go from dark to vivid to washed out by noon desert sun. My dining room faces west so I get to watch the shadow of the mountains in the east slip quietly along the city toward me and then, sunlight.<br /><br />If you practice Zen, you should learn to pay attention to the subtle changes of your senses as the day opens and closes.  These senses are teachings just as substantial as any master's.  Better: they are you, in your face, and willing to center you in the moment at any time.<br /><br />A few breaths' zazen, is all that is required.  Call it micro zazen, if you will.  .<br /><br />Life is a universe in itself, be open to it.<br /><br />Be well.
