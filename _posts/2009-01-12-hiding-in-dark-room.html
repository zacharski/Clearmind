With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />_____________________<br /><br />Hiding in a quiet moment<br /><br />In a darkened corner<br /><br />Of an old friend's house,<br /><br />I sat in complete stillness.<br /><br />We just picked away his gloss and left him<br /><br />As he truly was: naked before the Infinite.<br /><br />A couple of hats, some shirts, a few socks,<br /><br />And even a coat or two. The rest away to the<br /><br />Salvation Amy.                   I notice<br /><br />Our clothes disguise us before the Universe. <br /><br />Like Adam, we hide in the leaves of linen and cotton.<br /><br />We forget ourselves and who we really are:<br /><br />Then that singular moment.  I am here.<br /><br />_________________<br /><br /><br />That lovingkindness we Jews call Chesed requires courage. We are required to help our friends through the lifecycle, which is actually a cyclical mirror of our own lives. As we do, we see ourselves through our friends.<br /><br />It takes courage to be open to this sight. <br /><br />I look away often.  Words are my hiding place. They take me away from the feeling and drop me directly into thought.  So slick.<br /><br />But then, so is stillness at times.<br /><br />I knew receiving my friend's clothes after his death would be difficult.  I saw myself as a scavenger bird, as in the scene in Kundun when the Dalai Lama's father died and the birds picked clean his bones. It is a natural cycle, and we are all here to feed the universe in one way or another.<br /><br />Be well.<br /><br /><br />This evening we will sit in meditation at Temple Beth El at 7:00 PM.  Please join us.
