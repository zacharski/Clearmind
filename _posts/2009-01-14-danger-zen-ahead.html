With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />We each are stuck if we believe we have "a path" to walk. There is no path. When we envision "path" we envision and to do so creates an illusion at best and an ideal at worst.<br /><br />Yet, each us us will speak of our path.<br /><br /><br />What if the path is not really a path at all, but just being still?   I don't mean not moving.  I mean inner stillness, inner receptivity. <br /><br />Path suggests a beginning point and an end point somewhere on the horizon.  Zen has no horizon save that which is here right now. There is no where to go.<br /><br />Few of us believe this.  It is beyond our willingness to accept.  There must be something better! So, off we trot to find it.<br /><br />Heaven, Nirvana, Enlightenment. ..all very dangerous words and concepts, you see.  To be there is to be in hell.<br /><br />So, you want ice cream?  Ice cream would make you happy?  Live in ice cream, live in that happiness.  Now stay there forever.  How happy then?<br /><br />It is not our nature to remain in happiness, it is not happiness' nature to remain period.<br /><br />Everything comes and goes, when we attain this, no path arises.<br /><br />Be well.
