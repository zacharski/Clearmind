With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Impossible expectations are always a source of suffering. Over the last few weeks we have witnessed a war in Gaza. Hamas rockets for years were met with an overwhelming assault by Israel. Hamas places rocket launchers near hospitals and schools then claims Israel commits war crimes when it attacks those launching sites. Israel yesterday ceased fire, unilaterally. Hamas keeps up its rocket attacks. Hamas says it will do so until Israel leaves Gaza. Israel says it will leave Gaza when Hamas stops firing rockets over its borders.<br /><br />My heart suffers at the pain on both sides.<br /><br />Hamas says it will not stop fighting with Israel until Israel goes away. Its hate is deep and unrelenting. Hamas suffers. Hamas teaches its children to be joyful when Israelis die. Israelis teach children to be sad when any life is taken. Yet, when faced with a gun pointed at you and an enemy willing to kill you with it, somehow you must survive.<br /><br />The question is how.<br /><br />My prayers go out to all those who suffer in such circumstances. Both the ones with the guns and bombs and the ones who are the targets of the guns and bombs. We are all human beings. May both sides relent, seek peace, and find ways to embrace each other. an impossible expectation? Perhaps, But a righteous aim.<br /><br />So, we work and pray for peace and compassionate living knowing that any expectation that such will be the case will lead to suffering. This is the heart of Buddhist practice.<br /><br />Be well.<br /><br />PS.  I just read Hamas ordered a ceasefire!  Good news!
