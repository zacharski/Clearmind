With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />The sun rises over the Organ mountains as I sit in the comfort of my Zendo.  I have recently switched back to sandalwood incense.  I had been using cedar. Sandalwood is the incense my Teacher uses in his Zendo. I think I am yearning for connection.<br /><br />My Little Honey and I had a talk about this last night.  Connection is so important, yet a challenge for many, including myself.  By connection I don't mean the superficial, acquaintance level.  I mean a deeper, much more intimate level.  And yet, when I consider any deep connection but with the Infinite in the privacy of the Zendo, I feel anxious and vulnerable. Such a struggle.<br /><br />My response is to become defensive.  I talk.  I turn the conversation away.  I leave.<br /><br />Years of practice has helped me "see" these things. And I have adapted in some cases.  I rarely use intense anger to frighten people away.  Nor do I use the sort of intellectually arrogance sarcasm that was present in my grad school days.<br /><br />My technique is much more sophisticated now.  Yet, it leads to the very same place. A lack of real, sustaining, connection to others who are close to me and very important to me.<br /><br />Preparing for this class I am teaching at the Academy has made some of this very clear.  I am using my journal much more efficiently and purposefully. <br /><br />So, the good part about Zen practice is that it gets us close to the truth of ourselves, but there is a shortcoming, I think, in how we teach Zen in the US, since it is taught outside of a monastic community.  This shortcoming has to do with intimacy. <br /><br />Many of us who come to Zen experience this and its just fine because it is what we want.  Yet, that want is a real block to our growth as human beings.<br /><br />What do you think?<br /><br />Be well.
