With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />When we see clearly through to the Absolute, so what?  We realize emptiness, and? Our way is the highway.  We don't stop at the top of the mountain.  When we see clearly, friends, we see our work. <br /><br />Agent wrote on Zen Living:<br /><br />To see something as neededIs not to see something as it isBut it is to add our desire onto itThus, we see our desires as they are, too.<br /><br /><br />There are ten stages on the famous ox-herding pictures.  At some point after seeing realizing the Way, the ox-herder returns to the village.  He is "free and easy" in the market place. What do you think he does there?  What is his function there?<br /><br /><br />When the baby cries, what do you do? when to dog needs water, what do you do? Our bodhisattva vow has us responding to the cries of the world; it is not we who cry. We simply care.  This is our buddha-heart.<br /><br />Be well.
