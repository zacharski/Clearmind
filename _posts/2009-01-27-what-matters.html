With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />In the greater scheme of things, what really matters?  Do the big events of the day matter?  Does the sound of a beloved pet matter? <br /><br />What matters is what we invest meaning in.  Things themselves without relation to others have no meaning.  They come and go just as we do.  But human beings are meaning makers.  And we make meaning in terms of our relationship to things.<br /><br />If we have a distant relationship to nature and natural events, they will matter little.  If we have a close relationship to our pets, they will matter. <br /><br />Regardless, what matters most and what matters least will drop away in the natural course of events.  So, what really matters?<br /><br />The common denominator of all this is relationship.  It is very important to recognize that we are all interconnected, interconnected to the point that on the deepest level, we are all one, the entire universe is one. So, what matters most is our willingness to see and openness to nurture, relationship.<br /><br />It is in this nurturance that we begin to see and solidify our realization that, we and the universe are not two, but one and always have been.<br /><br />Reincarnation is just a matter of the Universe opening its eye through the continuous creation of eyes to open.<br /><br />May you be a blessing in the universe today.
