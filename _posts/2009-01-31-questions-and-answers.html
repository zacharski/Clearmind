With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Last night around 1:30 AM I woke with this sentence running through my mind, an apparent snippet of conversation,  "Yesterday's choices are today's questions."  I sense that this means each choice we make unfolds new questions and, from a spiritual point of view, its rarely the answers that matter; what really matters are the questions.  Why?<br /><br />Questions open us, answers close us.  Questions inspire us, answers satisfy us.  Questions ask us to look under something, answers assume there is no need to look further.<br /><br />As in life itself, in Zen practice there are no answers, only questions.  How we face these questions becomes critical and determines our character.  To answer a question with "don't know" mind, is to not really answer a question, but to open our mind to see what is really there as opposed to what we assume is there.<br /><br />Let your life be an open question.<br /><br />(I suspect the degree to which we feel comfortable with this is the degree to which we have attained don't know mind.)  <br /><br />Be well.
