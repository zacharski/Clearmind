With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />There is a slate sky becoming light blue outside my house. I study these things.  Ever since Vietnam I have had a near obsession with morning light.  The nights were so dark and dangerous there and the light of morning bathed me with a sense of hope. Yet, I also feel drawn to the night: soft, hidden. A time when our ears turn from human sound to nature's sound.<br />_____________<br /><br />So, now it is later in the morning.  Zazen is done.  Yoga is done. And the house is clean.<br /><br />Livvie, our granddaughter, is with us this morning.  She is not well and had to stay home from daycare. So, I made us all pancakes and sent her to play on the organ.  she loves to put on a recorded tune and either "play" along or dance to it.<br /><br />Three year olds are so interested and expressive!<br /><br />Anyway, I am not sure how to wrap this note into a spiritual practice other than to say its often enlightenment itself to be with children.<br /><br />Be well.
