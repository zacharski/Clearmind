With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />In Zen, we often will say something is so, then say it is not so. Some call this paradox. Some call it hooey. We would be mistaken if we thought it were "deep" or anything like that. <br />Master Seung Sahn happily points this out with his typical question, "are they the same or different?" Whack! to any thoughtful answer.<br /><br />Someone on the Zen Living list writes:  "I thought they were never "unwell" - they are just as they are." <br /><br />In one post I say I am ill.  In another I suggest illness does not exist.  In still another I sign, "Be well".   Very confusing, no?<br /><br />Even more so: there is never a time when a non-moving mind is sick, well, happy, sad and never a time when a non-moving mind is not sick, well, happy, sad.<br /><br />A non-moving mind is just mind experiencing mind or what Uchiyama-roshi calls the self becoming the self.<br />No thinking!<br /><br />No making dreams, fantasies, expectations, desires at the cost of just being.<br /><br />Just so, we think, we make dreams, have desires.<br /><br />Do you see?<br /><br />Our Small Mind world of fever, chills, sickness and wellness co-exists with our Big Mind world of Emptiness. They are one in the same, not two. It is for us to attain being within them fully awake to their wholeness, to their complete oneness, seamlessness, that is our practice. And even this is "empty."<br /><br />Leaving us to be well within our own existence regardless of its differentiated quality.<br /><br />Be well.
