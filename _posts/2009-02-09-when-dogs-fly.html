With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />The morning sun has already risen over the mountains and its glaring light is blasting through our windows. Then, in the blink, cool shade. It is going to be a cloudy day here.<br />Or a sunny day.  It depends on when your eyes are open.<br /><br />Life is like that.<br /><br />If our eyes are closed our world is self constructed in darkness. Imagination takes us to places unreal, chimera.<br /><br />If our eyes are open and we do not see clearly, its something else again.  We see our own creation, assign meaning to it, attach to it and suffer through it.<br /><br />If our eyes are open and we see clearly, our reality is as it is...or as Suzuki-roshi was fond of saying, we see "things as it is". In this "state"  (which is no state at all), A bird is a bird and a dog is a dog. No problem.<br /><br />As the kabbalists say, though, come and see...<br /><br />We say a dog is a dog and a bird is a bird.  We say on the one hand they are the same, buddha nature, empty, and so on.  Yet there they are, one barks and runs, the other flies and sings, different.<br /><br />But birds bark and dogs sing, dogs fly and birds run. The same. How do birds run and bark as dogs fly and sing?  Look deeply.<br /><br />When we use our own words and phrases, big problem.  Look deeply, get inside the oneness of life. There resides the answer.<br /><br />Be well.
