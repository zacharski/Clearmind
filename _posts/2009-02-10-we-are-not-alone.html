With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />We sat last night, a small group, in a very large sanctuary, bringing light into the world. I say this because we don't sit zazen for ourselves, but for all beings. As we open our eyes we see for all beings, as we take a step, we step for all beings, as we bow to our cushions, we bow for all beings. The entire universe sat in that small sanctuary last night.<br /><br />Attaining this mind means some very important things.  As we are one, we are all.  Every action is a reflection of this oneness. To think, "I alone am responsible" is always incorrect.  There is never a moment when we are alone and solely responsible. Our fathers and mothers, grandfathers, grandmothers, generations of generations are with us here and now in our genes, our breath, our very touch.  So too our friends and enemies, our coaches and critics: generations of generations, here, now, in this breath.  How can we ever be alone?<br /><br />To take a step is auspicious. Therefore, be mindfull where and how you place your foot.<br /><br />Be well.
