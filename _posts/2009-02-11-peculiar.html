With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Zen is so peculiar.<br />Its like the sword brandished by Manjushri<br />cutting through delusion,<br />but also like Kannon who embraces us as we fall.<br /><br />To practice Zen is to practice without meaning.<br /><br />There is the Buddha, kill him!<br /><br />There is the Buddha, embrace him!<br /><br />When is Zen not peculiar?  When we live directly, authentically, and don't call it Zen.<br />When we see a rose and really see the rose itself.<br />When we meet a person and see that person for himself, as he is.<br /><br />But also, when the alarm rings we get up.<br />When its time to eat, we eat. <br />When we have a problem to address, we address it.<br /><br />Each moment an invitation to open.<br />Each moment an opportunity to undress.<br />As the kabbalists say, 'rung upon rung!'<br /><br />Going nowhere we are not already.<br /><br />Be well.
