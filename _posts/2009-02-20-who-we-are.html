With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />"To study the Way is to study the self, to study the self is to let the self fall away, to let the self fall away is to be enlightened by the myriad things." or so says Master Dogen of the 13th century..<br /><br />Many "myriad" commentators have had their say about what this all means. I like to look at the lat line. When we have no self we are in a position to learn. What does this mean?<br /><br />Learning requires a setting aside of what we think we know. It requires the ability and skill to listen deeply. We have lost this art in our society. As we have lost the ability to hold civil discourse.<br /><br />Agendas rule. Self is so very important. We seek books, classes, and news that confirms our view rather than challenge our view.<br /><br />As we practice Zen, we learn this truth. We see it in operation in our mind. We have the opportunity in the practice, to cut through the strings of delusion, anger, and greed, setting us free. In this free light, in this awakened light, we see that nothing is forever, nothing lasts more than a millisecond. W are fresh every moment.<br /><br />An agenda is not a life. A sale does not a person make. Nor does his clothes.<br /><br />In truth, there is no singular person. We are one, together with the Infinite. The blade of grass our master, the pebble in our shoe, our teacher.<br /><br />Let us learn.<br /><br />Be well.
