<div>With palms together,</div><div>Good Morning Everyone,</div><div> </div><div>There are some interesting questions that arise from a deep practice of Zen.  For one thing, as we sit and come to realize this self is not permanent, that it is not the center of the universe, and in fact, all of the universe is One, then what is up or down?  What is right or wrong?  The lack of an Absolute point is disconcerting as all relative points are in relation to it.<br /></div><div>Without an Absolute point that exists apart from us there can be no movement, for example, as movement is defined always in relation to an observer who is presumably at some absolute point.  Oy.  I'm getting a headache, already.</div><div> </div><div>My temple rabbi suggests that biblical mitzvot are the baseline. Yet, even these exist in relationship to a culture in a time. They are only correct if we say they are correct. and then they can only be correct for those who agree. </div><div> </div><div>On the other hand, we might ask if there are any moral points that are true regardless of the existence of a <span id="lw_1236347801_0" class="yshortcuts">fixed point</span>, in other words, are there moral imperatives that are correct regardless of context, time, or culture, etc.?  </div><div> </div><div>We take refuge in <span style="BORDER-BOTTOM: #0066cc 1px dashed; CURSOR: hand" id="lw_1236347801_1" class="yshortcuts">Buddha</span>, awakening, an attainment of true nature, we know this <em>nature</em> to be "empty" yet we vow to cease doing evil, to do good, etc. Good and bad are terms relative to each other. Hmmm. </div><div> </div><div>Jews pray to come closer to God, in the end that God is absolutely unknowable, He is Ein Sof, the Infinite.  And He is Ayin, Nothing. </div><div> </div><div>So  there we are, on top of that hundred foot pole, basking in True Awareness.  Everything is one, everything is empty, we have attained awakening. So?</div><div> </div><div>As the koan asks, what is your next step?</div><div> </div><div>I add, and how do you know that it is the right step?</div><div> </div><div>__________</div><div> </div><div>A reminder, We will practice Zen at Clear Mind Zendo Sunday morning at 9:00 AM, I will begin teaching a class on Kabbalah at Temple Beth El on Sunday at 2:00 PM, and we will NOT practice meditation at Temple this Monday night due to <span id="lw_1236347801_2" class="yshortcuts">Purim</span> festivities.</div><div> </div><div>Be well.</div>
