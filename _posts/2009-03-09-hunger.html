<div>With palms together,</div><div>Good Morning Everyone,</div><div> </div><div>There is a hunger in the world, a ferocious hunger. People are starving in the sterility of mind. People are starving in mountains of books. People are starving in hoards in schools. They eat, but are far from satisfied.  No one seems ever to be satisfied. They seek, and seek, and seek: faces blue; necks thin and gaunt, bodies in deep hunger.<br /></div><div>What satisfies? What fills the stomach? What relaxes the neck and opens the throat?</div><div> </div><div>Drugs, sex, rock &amp; roll?  No.</div><div> </div><div>Another book by Thich Nhat Hahn or the <span style="BORDER-BOTTOM: #0066cc 1px dashed; CURSOR: hand" id="lw_1236605917_0" class="yshortcuts">Dalai Lama</span>? No.  Perhaps a new version of the Holy Scriptures? No.</div><div> </div><div>A wall.  A cushion. A still, quiet room. </div><div> </div><div>Go there.  </div><div> </div><div>Sit. </div><div> </div><div>Look inside.</div><div> </div><div>Open the valves and let things flow. </div><div> </div><div>When working at your desk, feel the materials under your fingertips: know the many lives and many hands that brought you the tools you use to make your living. Appreciate your life. Appreciate your friends, your spouse, your parents, your children. </div><div> </div><div>Get wet with life.  Feel the dirt. Roll in the mud of not-knowing.  </div><div> </div><div>Another book?  Maybe. Another path?  Maybe.  </div><div> </div><div>The most important point?  Live without a self.</div><div> </div><div>Living without a self means satisfaction is not an aim. Living without a self is to live in release. Open.  In service to others. No worries, No fears.  No problems. Just this, the next thing to do.</div><div> </div><div>May you each be a blessing in the universe.</div><div> </div>
