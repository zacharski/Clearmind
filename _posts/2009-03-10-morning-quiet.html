<div>With palms together,</div><div><span id="lw_1236694179_0" class="yshortcuts">Good Morning Everyone</span>,</div><div> </div><div>In the morning we have an opportunity to be quiet. No, you say?  We must attend to children or aged parents. We get ready for work, reconnect with our spouse or partner, and maybe the world through the Net or TV or radio.  Still, even so, we have an opportunity for quiet.  Interior quiet is mindful quiet.  </div><div> </div><div>We might not turn on the radio. We might leave the TV set to gather some dust. And if we must, we allow the computer to quietly display the news. Reading it, we pay attention to our posture, our breath, and our presence. Attending to our children, we practice mindful attention. Talking, we know we are talking.  Connecting, we know we are connecting.  Loving, we know we are loving. All in a network of interconnection. All done with interior quiet.</div><div> </div><div>No time to meditate?  Oh, excuse me, but what about the bathroom?  Do we not sit down every morning? Isn't the door closed?  <span id="lw_1236694179_1" class="yshortcuts">Carpe Diem</span>! Extend your time on the toilet a few minutes, <span style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BACKGROUND: none transparent scroll repeat 0% 0%; CURSOR: hand" id="lw_1236694179_2" class="yshortcuts">paying attention</span> to just being present. <em>Bathroom Zen.</em></div><div><em></em> </div><div>For myself, mornings are always special. Waking to the morning light I am so grateful for the opportunity to be.</div><div> </div><div>Let us each walk in such light.</div><div> </div><div>Be well.</div><div> </div>
