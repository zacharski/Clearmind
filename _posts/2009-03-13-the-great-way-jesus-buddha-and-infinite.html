<div>With palms together,</div><div>Good Morning Everyone,</div><div> </div><div>On our Zen Living list we are discussing comparative religion. <span id="lw_1236948380_0" class="yshortcuts">Comparative religion</span> can be very interesting and informative. We approach with: are they the same or different?  From a Zen point of view, it is this question that is, itself a koan.</div><div> </div><div>Neither, both, whatever, each gets us into trouble because we are looking with categorical, discriminating eyes.</div><div> </div><div>There is only life. From <span id="lw_1236948380_1" class="yshortcuts">closed eyes</span>, discrimination occurs. </div><div> </div><div>There is only Buddha Nature, the Ein Sof, the Infinite Emptiness, <em>before</em> it is these names.</div><div> </div><div>From this, through discrimination, arise Jesus, <span id="lw_1236948380_2" class="yshortcuts">Buddha</span>, the Prophets, you, me, plants and animals, up and down. The same or different?</div><div> </div><div>We look at a picture and see in accordance with our neural pathways. We release our eyes, our history of perception, and other images emerge.  The same or different?</div><div> </div><div>I feel ice on my tongue, feel rain on my head, feel water in my mouth, steam in my shower: are they the same or different?</div><div> </div><div>We begin with the Infinite, we can see the Infinite in the particular and know the same and the particular are both, one. Same and different.</div><div> </div><div>We begin with the particular and, on the path, see the Universal. </div><div> </div><div>When we don't step onto the path in the first place, we only see what we see from one point of view.  Our sight is filtered by history, desire, and a need to protect ourselves from change.</div><div> </div><div>In the end, as in the beginning, concepts and categories have very limited usefulness. At some point along the way, they become clear hindrances to awakening.</div><div> </div><div>Be well.<br /><br />PS.
