This is a good thing.  </div><div> </div><div>Yesterday, after Talmud, I spent the day with son Jason. He fixed my '95 Saab 900s.  I watched and helped as I could.  We had to take the oil pan out and clean a filter that rests inside it.  It was an interesting process.  Jack up the car; off with the <span style="BORDER-BOTTOM: #0066cc 1px dashed; CURSOR: hand" id="lw_1237119403_0" class="yshortcuts">air filter</span>, off with a wheel, off with a wheel well guard, jack up the engine a little, out with the oil pan.  Clean everything, reverse the process, put in a new oil filter and fresh oil, and what do you know?  No oil light, no "check engine" light.   </div><div> </div><div>Jason is so comfortable around engines. I admire him. His confidence and knowledge about the intricacies of the various systems of an engine was comforting to me, but more, inspiring.</div><div> </div><div>This is his Zen.</div><div> </div><div>We concluded the day with a short havdallah ceremony.  While Livvie thoroughly enjoyed the spice box, she put her hands to her ears as the braided candle was dippid into the wine. A good week.</div><div> </div><div>Be well. <br /></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>
