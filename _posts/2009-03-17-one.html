With palms together, <p>Good Morning Everyone,</p><p> </p><p>The Great Way is Infinite Oneness.  The Great Way is not a path, it is the thing itself: no-thing, everything. The Great Way and Buddha Nature are the same, not different, yet we live as if they were different. One a path, the other the end of the path, but this is two. There is only One. </p><p> </p><p>Live One. </p><p> </p><p>Here is the thing.  As we live One, all things manifest as One.  As we live One: generosity is One, patience is One, morality is One, vigor is One, meditation is One, and Wisdom is Itself.  The six paramitas are not six, but One. As we live One, there is no two. Keep One.</p><p> </p><p>To keep One only think of the Universe. Begin and end with the Universe.  As we practice, Self and Universe are realized as the same, not different, yet we perceive as if they were different. They are the same. You and Other are One, the same, yet appearing different. </p><p> </p><p>A prism shows one and many are the same. One light, many colors.  Let your practice be your prism. Both sides of the prism are the same, yet different, both are One.</p><p> </p><p> And when we get to One, take the next step. One and Not-One are the same, not different. </p><p> </p><p>Live Not-One.</p><p> </p><p>Be well.</p>
