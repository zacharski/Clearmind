<div>With palms together,</div><div><span style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BACKGROUND: none transparent scroll repeat 0% 0%; CURSOR: hand" id="lw_1237401768_0" class="yshortcuts">Good Morning</span> All,</div><div> </div><div>Yesterday I wrote about One. The thing is, we live in a multiplicity.  Or so it seems to us as our brain processes automatically our perceptions into classes of this and that, subjects, objects, processes, etc.  It is difficult to see what comes before the perception. </div><div> </div><div>Kabbalists argue we must use our imagination.  Perhaps.  We enter the map of the Infinite through this tool.  We call this map the <span style="BORDER-BOTTOM: #0066cc 1px dashed; CURSOR: hand" id="lw_1237401768_1" class="yshortcuts">Tree of Life</span> or sometimes the Ten Seferot.  Yesterday I referenced the six paramitas.  The sefirot are much the same. These are the natural emanations or (perhaps) attributes of the Infinite made perceptible through ourselves.  </div><div> </div><div>We have Will, Wisdom, Understanding, Love, Power, Beauty, Eternity, Splendor, Foundation, and Presence.  These go by various names which essentially deepen their meaning and application, but they are understood to be a sort of divine reflection. if you will. </div><div> </div><div>We should not understand these as separate from each other, just as we do not understand the paramitas as separate.  Each contains the entire universe.  Each is One.</div><div> </div><div>How do we approach these?  How do we realize these?  By dropping away the ego and stepping into the <span id="lw_1237401768_2" class="yshortcuts">Universal</span>. Because we cannot really "know" our essential nature and the essential nature of the Infinite, these sefirot are manifest.  We know the Infinite through them.  If you want to know "Buddha Nature"  the "Infinite" or "God" get in touch with these perfections. </div><div> </div><div>Be well.<br /></div>
