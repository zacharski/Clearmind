<div>With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />What is good? Is good relative? If there is an absolute good, how do we know it and what is its source? Last night we had a rather animated discussion regarding ethics. It was interesting in that it seemed to me many people want an absolute upon which to rely. Yet, I maintain all things, including values, are relative and cannot be otherwise.<br /><br />Some years ago a fellow named Fletcher wrote a book that lit a firestorm. Its title was "Situation Ethics". In it he argued that ethics were relative and dependant upon a given situation. People, especially religious people as I recall, had a field day tearing apart the notion of a situationally based ethics, yet, again as I recall, had little problem when pressed saying "that depends" in sticky wicket ethical dilemmas. This is internally inconsistent, and in my opinion, retracts from absolute ethics. Absolute is absolute to be internally consistent.<br /><br />Still, we yearn for black and white solutions and eschew gray. Yet, in gray resides great wonder and diversity. How can ethics not be situational? Should we not consider the parties involved, their culture, their religious values, etc., in determining what is good, right or correct? Can there be a standard which overarchs all people in all circumstances at all times?<br /><br />Perhaps, but I suspect it is principle rather than rule. We seek the good, a principle, but use the relative values of our hearts and minds and cultural resources to assist us in determining that "good".<br /><br />For me this leads to a dialectical tension between the Relative and the Absolute. Both co-exist, are rooted in the same source, and are mutually dependent upon each other. Indeed, they are the same, in essence, it is just the POV that changes.<br /><br />We must look evil in the eye, one person argued. I agree. I add, however, that when we do, and we look deeply, that we will see we are looking into a mirror. That mirror is our actual humanity. Good and bad are constructs arising from our situation. We think them into existence. Nature, itself, has no good or bad. So, when we look for the source of good, we must look to ourselves, so to, evil.<br /><br />I believe when we fully appreciate the actuality of our humanity it is possible to truly forgive and reconcile with those who have threatened us, harmed us, or otherwise done us wrong. When we seek for the benefit of the Infinite and not for ourselves and know that all are One, then who, other than ourselves, can be our enemy?<br /><br />Be well.<br /><br /></div>
