<div>With palms together,</div><div>Good Morning Everyone,</div><div> </div><div>Today is mine to make. It's as simple as that. While we cannot always predict the sort of things that will happen, we are responsible for how we perceive them and how we respond to them.  In short, we are responsible for what meaning we make of our day and the quality of the interactions throughout.</div><div> </div><div>The challenge is to be aware and responsive to this truth from <span id="lw_1237560429_0" class="yshortcuts">moment to moment</span>.  We must be willing to practice this and not assume it will happen. It is a part of our disciplined <span style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BACKGROUND: none transparent scroll repeat 0% 0%; CURSOR: hand" id="lw_1237560429_1" class="yshortcuts">spiritual practice</span>. This takes both sensitivity and willingness.</div><div> </div><div>As the day unfolds and events happen we don't expect or like, we might say to ourselves, "This moment is mine to make, may I make it generous and thoughtful".  Relaxing into the moment, we can deliberately be present.    </div><div> </div><div>So, being awake in the moment requires us to be aware of ourselves as being intimately connected to all who are present with us. Know when you are feeling annoyed, feeling tired, or feeling greedy (self-absorbed). Make an effort to relax in these feelings and let their hold on you go. As we relax, so to will others.  As we take a moment to bring ourselves back to our breath, so will others.  Opening the space in any moment allows room for mindful attention.  Remember, one of our most wonderful characteristics as spiritual beings is to be generous with ourselves.</div><div> </div><div>Be well.</div><div> </div>
