<p>With palms together,</p><p>Good Morning Everyone,</p><p></p><p>Last night at Temple Meditation, what I like to call Zen Judaism, after the book by the same name (author, Rabbi Joseph Gelberman), we discussed good and evil, the precepts, and how this plays out in everyday life. </p><p></p><p>When all things are relative, how can we know what is good or bad in everyday life? I've written about this before, but it is the "everyday life" part that intrigues me. Once we begin and sustain a strong practice of mindfulness, our lives will change. The changes will be subtle and often a challenge to discern, but they will be there. We will notice our impact on others, other's impact on us. We will not our reactions. We will notice their reactions. In true form to symbolic interactionism, we will make adjustments in our "self". These adjustments will allow for a subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) change in us, in our presentation of ourselves to the world. </p><p></p><p>When we behave in ways that positively affect others, we are doing "good". When we behave in ways that negatively affects others, we are doing "bad". In Zen, the notion of harm is attached, almost as a definition, of evil. Moreover, it is never seen as independent of behavior. In other words, evil and good are not independent of us, they are us as we enact ourselves in the world. When we cause harm, we are doing (manifesting) evil. When we cause well-being, enhance life, we are doing good. </p><p></p><p>In our everyday life we are presented with myriad opportunities to make life better or worse for those around us. When we pay attention, with our eyes wide open, we will see what is good and what is not.</p><p></p><p><strong>Be Well.</strong></p><strong><div>With palms together,</div><div><span style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BACKGROUND: none transparent scroll repeat 0% 0%; CURSOR: hand" id="lw_1238333182_0" class="yshortcuts">Good Morning Everyone</span>,</div><div> </div><div>This morning is, once again, cold.

I am told by the weather report that the temps will climb quickly today.  I plan to ride my bike to the Temple for class.  Let's see if the Trickster has gone back into her den.  Bike, foot, car: no difference.</div><div> </div><div>Life is life that.</div><div> </div><div>Constant change; constant surprise.</div><div> </div><div>When we train ourselves to be delighted by change, awed by surprise, life itself becomes an every moment <span style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BACKGROUND: none transparent scroll repeat 0% 0%; CURSOR: hand" id="lw_1238333182_3" class="yshortcuts">amusement park</span>.

The Trickster is a marvelous Master. </div><div> </div><div>To become a Master yourself, you must come to realize this and bow before her.<br /></div><div>Be well.</div></strong><p> </p>
