With palms together,<br />Good Morning everyone,<br /><br />The morning opens, as we open, slowly, with a stretch and maybe a yawn. It is important to be present in this process. We witness the sun rise over the horizon, (in my case, the Organ mountains) and as we do, we appreciate the wonder of creation.  It is there for us to appreciate, if only we pay attention.<br /><br />What is the currency of this payment?  A willingness to slow ourselves down.  Multi-tasking, while sounding as if we can accomplish much in little time, disallows appreciation. It takes us away from being present, from delight, and from seeing deeply. The focus of multi-tasking is on the ends, not the means. Yet, it is our means that contain our intention. Without a focus on intention, there is little human meaning in an activity, little quality, and certainly, little appreciation.<br /><br />As we slow down, we allow ourselves the joy of being rather than the hope of becoming. The hope of becoming creates idols in the mind.  Smash them. Cut them loose. Slow down and feel, see, taste, touch, smell, think.  While these are impermenant, they exist for a reason.    <br /><br />We appreciate through our senses. I feel the warmth of my coffee cup, delight that it says, "Wake up!" on it's side.  Yet know, as is true of all conditioned things, it will fall away sometime, as I will fall away, you will fall away: everything comes and everything goes.  What is left is our appreciation and the karmic footprint left in its wake.<br /><br />When we appreciate, we care; when we care, we do good; when we do good, good follows.<br /><br />Pass it on.<br /><br />Be well.
