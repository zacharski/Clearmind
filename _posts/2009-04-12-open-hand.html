With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br />How beautiful!  The sun just broke over the mountains and lit up the valley below. It is so bright!  The desert seems to yawn in its presence, roll itself over, open up, and warm itself.  The birds are at our feeder.  And I see a wonderful blue sky. It is supposed to become windy today.  Of course, it is spring and in the desert southwest, that means windy days.<br /><br />My son Jacob is in town.  He is a chef, for those who don't know, and he may be moving back to Las Cruces.  We are excited about this possibility. Granddaughter Sami is also here.  We are thoroughly enjoying our Passover.<br /><br />Yesterday we drove to White Sands and were sand-blasted.  It was really interesting to try to climb the dunes in blowing sand.  After a strenuous hour, the picnic lunch we brought looked terrific and we ate in the cover of wind-blocking shade canopies that cover each picnic table.<br /><br />Zen is about going with the flow with a certain attitude.  That attitude is openness.  One must become a hand that opens and allows the wind to flow through it's fingers. If we hold up our hands in the wind and open our fingers, the air flows around and through; as we close our fingers and cup our hands, we catch the wind, offering it resistance.  One case is open, needing little actual strength; the other is closed and requires great strength to keep its position. In either case, we have a hand in the wind, but in which case are we able to be truly present?<br /><br />It takes great strength, though, to remain open.  It is a strength of a different sort.  It is the strength that comes with zazen.  The strength of vulnerability. Anyone can wear a shield and feel brave; it takes true courage to go without a shield: open, vulnerable, and present.<br /><br />Open your hand, feel your openness. Open your hand, feel your freedom. <br /><br />For those who celebrate Easter, may your day be the blessing it is intended to be.<br /><br />Be well.
