With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Today I would like to talk to you about the Dharma. What is this thing we call "Dharma" anyway?  The term has become popular to the point that there was a TV show with Dharma in it's title.  Dharma comes from the Buddha's mouth.  Dharma comes from the Buddha's heart.  Dharma surrounds us. Everything is Dharma.  Yet Dharma is nothing. It is a finger pointing to the moon.<br /><br />One meaning is that Dharma is the teaching of the Buddha transmitted either 'mind to mind' or in oral history or in scripture.  Another meaning of Dharma is that it is the unadorned, absolute truth.  Still another, is that it is reality itself.<br /><br />Dharma just is.  We discover Dharma as we unfold our minds and hearts to manifest it, to receive it, and to transmit it.<br /><br />Again, keep in mind, all dharmas are empty.  This is to say that even the truth, even reality itself, even the Absolute, has no permanence. Everything, every idea, every thought, feeling, sensation, everything, is in process. The universe is flow.<br /><br />And if flow is the essential nature of the universe, what is the Universal? Flow.<br /><br />Take refuge in this.<br /><br />Be well, be open.
