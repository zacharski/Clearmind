With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />The dawn is stealth personified.  Light shows itself ever so slowly, nearly imperceptibly, as dark recedes.  Zazen can be like that.  We sit with attention. We witness the world around us.  At some point, imperceptibly so, the world and we are not the world and we, but one experience. We take this understanding from our cushion into the everyday world.<br /><br />What's this?<br /><br />Being in this 'world is One' state is not the final step.<br /><br />What is the next step?  The step that takes us back into duality with non-duality eyes.<br /><br />What's this? <br /><br />The dishes, experiencing no separation.  The laundry, experiencing no separation.  Making breakfast experiencing no separation. What is Buddha? The laundry, the dishes, the breakfast.<br /><br />Dishes, laundry, breakfast are one in the same: awakened life.<br /><br />We take refuge in this "awakened life",  this state of non-duality.We call it Buddha Nature, and those who live it, buddhas.<br /><br />This is what it means to take refuge in the Buddha.
