With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />The dishwasher is changed out<br />and the kitty litter replaced:<br />everyday chores, everyday Zen.<br />The Zen of the Everyday<br />is the highest and the lowest<br />form of practice.<br />It is ubiquitous.<br /><br />Wake up!<br /><br />Unfold your mind<br />and open like a flower in the morning light.<br />Wrap your self in extinction<br />and the universe is your Teacher.<br />This dish wounded, this one fine:<br />make no distinction,<br />only wash the dish<br />and put it away.<br /><br /><br />Be well.
