With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Many of you have privately asked about me, both in person, and via email. Thank you for your thoughtfulness and your sensitivity.  I am well.  Of course, life has offered both its typical and atypical stones-to-boulder's in the road, but that is to be expected. My Little Honey and I celebrated our 28th wedding anniversary yesterday. My son Jacob is in treatment for both emotional and chemical issues, the dream of a family restaurant collapsed and laid bare. We are struggling to keep the pieces and values of family together.  Bronchitis and allergies haven't helped. Still, I say I am well.<br /><br />Our lives are what they are: a gift to us. This gift is perfect regardless of what we think or feel about it. Every facet is a teacher, every turn, a lesson. Our challenge is to be open and present each moment.When we are willing to see this way, everything is an opportunity<br /><br />This is difficult. Life can wear us down.  I often want to withdraw to my Zendo or bedroom.  I turn on a television show and drift away.I feel such limited energy, yet I have the experience to know that down under the stinking thinking is a vast reservoir of vitality, love, and compassion.  This energy is the stuff of the universe and it is everywhere. I tapped it at mile 22 of a 26.2 mile race.  I tapped it in the jungle in the middle of a firefight.  I tapped it in graduate school and a thousand other places and moments during my life.<br /><br />The Zen of Living is the Zen of each moment: taste life in all its flavors. Embrace life in all its forms and stages.  And in each space and each step embrace peace.<br /><br />May you each be a blessing in the universe.
