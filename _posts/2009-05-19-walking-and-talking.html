With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Friends Allen and Eve just finished hiking a 2.8 mile out and back desert trail hike with Judy and me. Allen and I walk together, while Eve and Judy pair off, and we tend to talk about a variety of issues.  I have found this to be a very cleansing habit, one that when I fail to go, I miss very much. There is much to be gained by opening one's heart to others. Of course, the other obvious benefit is in the walking itself. While I also enjoy runs alone and biking alone, long walks with a friend are of a wholly different order.<br /><br />Zen, on the other hand, is a quiet, introspective practice.  We sit facing a wall in silence. Talking is discouraged. Of course, this is an excellent practice, as well. It is quite possible we Americans talk entirely too much. The conversations that occur on long walks are of a very different variety.  These are conversations that uncover and release; conversations that bridge and unite; conversations that deepen the bonds between human beings. Along the way, they are also conversations that free us from the bonds of ourselves. In Zen we might say we are "presenting ourselves as we will."<br /><br />Many of us go along emotionally constipated.  We squeak out meaningless words here and there, words without authenticity or personal import.  We can even talk incessantly about nonsense. As a result we do not touch ourselves. Too bad really, we could use a little emotional Ex-lax, once in awhile.  Maybe with such medicine we wouldn't be such an uptight and paranoid culture.  Maybe we would actually be able to relax and enjoy the ride. And get to know ourselves more completely in the process.<br /><br />For me, a desert walk with a friend three or four times a week is very much what the doctor ordered,.  I would encourage us all to do the same.<br /><br />Be well.
