With palms together,<br />Good Morning!<br /><br />My Dharma Grandfather, Matsuoka-roshi, was fond of shouting "Silence is Thunder!"  and, in fact, there was some talk of using this as the name of an Order of his dharma heirs.  When we are silent, what happens? <br /><br />What is the sound of one hand clapping?<br /><br />If silence is thunder, then what is thunder?  Words?<br />Silence decidedly is not in-action.  Remember, because we have silenced a person does not mean we have converted him.  Sometimes (more often than not) actions are shouts and words, mere whispers.<br /><br />When spoken to, there is an expectation of verbal response.  When it is not forthcoming, what?  Silence is loud.  It creates open space.  It is a deep and dark canyon, be careful!<br /><br />So, what do you think Sensei Matsuoka meant by this 'silence is thunder'?<br /><br />Be well.
