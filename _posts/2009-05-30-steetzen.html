With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />This morning I will practice streetZen at the Southwest Environmental Center at the open air Downtown Mall from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM.  If you are interested, please bring a cushion and join me. <br /><br />Followers of the Buddha Way have practiced this sort of practice since the time of the Buddha himself. streetZen is practiced in mindful silence. A dana bowl is used. In the past, Buddha taught we should walk, approach a home, and simply stand with our bowls. In the USA no one would have any idea what we were doing and we would likely be arrested. Better to go to a public venue and practice Zazen.  The benefit is the witness of serene reflection meditation.<br /><br />I invite you to do this practice.<br /><br />Be well.
