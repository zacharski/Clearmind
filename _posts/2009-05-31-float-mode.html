With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />This morning I got up at 5:00 and began picking up, dusting, and polishing. We did most of the other stuff yesterday, the floors, sweeping, etc. Today we will host a party for Olivia (Livvie).  We plan to have a pony here for her and her friends to ride.  It is going to be a major effort to remain in float mode. :)<br /><br />Zen is about float mode, so to speak.  There's the choppy water float.  There's the serene water float. All the while paddling toward that shore we are already standing on. Some of us have a need to flail around in the water, cursing the choppy when we seek serene. Yet serene is within us at all times.<br /><br />Even with screaming children.<br /><br />Here's the thing.  When we are awake and aware of our oneness with all things, we easily feel the tension rise as things begin to go south.  We breath into it, embrace it, and let it go with our breath.  When there is too much and the storm is overtaking us, we walk away.  We take a break.  We practice zazen. There is no harm in taking a break; yet great harm in overstaying our ability to deal with things that are getting out of hand. As Clint Eastwood says, "a  man's gotta know his limitations."<br /><br />When we fail to get out of the way of the storm or don't know how to ride it, we point our fingers, blaming everyone under the sun for our suffering.  All the shoulds and coulds and woulds come out like lightning biting at other's butts.    Not very Zen.  On the other hand, very Zen. Zen is only what the moment is.<br /><br />The key is training and awareness with the added willingness to take a step away.  May we each walk in wonder and ease.<br /><br />Remember, silence is thunder.<br /><br />Be well.
