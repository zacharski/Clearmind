With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Yesterday I read a few of my Dharma Grandfather's Teishos.  They had to do with Zen in everyday life and included many reference to the Vietnam war and the self-immolation of Buddhist monks.  I have a photograph of one of them and, of course, fairly vivid memories of seeing this on the TV news.<br /><br />The teishos and the burning monks brought my mind to look at life and death.  Life and death are the key issues of Zen priests and practitioners. Life and death is the source of seeing clearly.<br /><br />We are asleep most of the time.  Walking like zombies through our day. Wake up!When we practice Zen and commit to facing reality, we are committed to finding the answer to life and death...and there is an answer. When our eyes are open, there it is.<br /><br />Practice to open your eyes.<br /><br />Be well.
