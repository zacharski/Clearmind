With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Internet Student Rose asked about streetZen.  So, to answer her I am writing today about my practice, the practice I call streetZen.<br /><br />Bernie Glassman-roshi, founder of Zen Peacemaker Sangha, wrote a wonderful book entitled, "Bearing Witness".  In it he describes his street work.  Bearing witness to homelessness, poverty, war and so on.  His practice includes actually becoming homeless for a period.  Taking nothing with us, we just  sit with the population we are bearing witness on behalf of.<br /><br />I used to participate in peace protests after I returned from fighting in the Vietnam war.  I was uncomfortable with the adversarial role I often felt the protesters had with others. It was about peace and non-violence, but anger and patriotism are a challenging poison to serenity. Awhile ago I met my friend, Claude Anshin Thomas, author of "At Hell's Gate", and street Zen Priest.  Anshin practices homeless wondering and lectures on Peace and Non-Violence.  Like me, he is a combat veteran.  His practice strongly influenced me and mine.<br /><br />So, over the last two years or so I began a practice I am calling streetZen. In this practice I simple sit zazen in public places. The places I select have to do with particular issues, such as the environment, veterans, etc.  If I am sitting on behalf of the environment, I consider myself an Earth Witness.  If I sit at Veteran's Park, I am there as a Peace Witness. One other form of practice is Soup Kitchen work.  I did that for awhile, but haven't recently.  In this, I simply volunteer at the local soup kitchen and put in a few hours there.<br /><br />The ground rules of the practice are simple.  Practice zazen.  No talking.  If spoken to, reply quietly, politely, and with a gassho and bow. At the soup kitchen, the work is similar to  "samu" or "work meditation"  and the rules would include mindful silence and mindful practice as I cut things, place things, etc. <br /><br />When practicing streetZen, I place a small sign in front of me.  It simply says "PEACE" or "Earth Witness".  I also have a begging bowl and sometimes incense. I chant the Heart Sutra at the beginning and end of the sitting period.<br /><br />I currently sit Earth Witness at the SW Environmental Center at the Downtown Mall in Las Cruces on Saturday Morning from 9:00 to 10:00 AM.  I am considering renewing my Peace witness practice at Veteran's Park on Wednesdays at 4:00 - 5:00 PM. as the Temple Beth El sitting group seems to have gone on vacation this summer.<br /><br />I invite everyone to join me.  If not in Las Cruces, then in your own town or city. The world needs Bodhisattva witnesses. <br /><br />May you each be a blessing today.
