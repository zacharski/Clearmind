With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />This morning a moon<br />so large and beautiful<br />sat just above the horizon. <br />It nearly took my mind away. <br />I stopped and witnessed this wonder. <br />Then, the dishes called,<br />and the plants needed water,<br />and the coffee needed to be made,<br />and the Zendo required my presence. <br />Each a wonder of its own.<br /><br />Please enjoy your day.<br /><br />Be well.
