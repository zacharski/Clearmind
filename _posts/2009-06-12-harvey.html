With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />I am writing in the blog portion of my new Yahoo Profile.  This is the old Yahoo 360, now reincarnated as Yahoo Profiles.  If you were a connection of mine on Yahoo 360 on either Buddhist99 or harveyhilbert IDs, please connect to me on the Yahoo profile, harveyhilbert.<br /><br />In any event, it is morning and we finally were able to finish watching "Last Chance, Harvey" last night.   I am a little disturbed that the name "Harvey" is so often portrayed as a weak, timid person, a stumble-bum, or a fool.  Yet, there it is.  The good news is that these characters, including the Harvey of this film, often rise to the occasion.  Dustin Hoffman is himself, a bit self-effacing, but clearly authentic.  The film is worth watching if for no other reason than it is a portrayal of small triumphs with large implications for our behavior toward one another. One added benefit, the film is a love story without a single sex scene, naked chest, or bare butt. <br /><br />Reminder: streetZen at the downtown mall at 9:00 AM tomorrow.<br /><br />Be well.
