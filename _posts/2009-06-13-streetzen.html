With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />This morning I will sit streetZen at the downtown mall.  I do this as prayer work, a witnessing on behalf of sanity and serenity.  Our world seems so filled with hate and violence. Hateful people killing other people, greedy people raping the Earth and her resources, deluded people believing they are somehow independent of everyone and everything else and justifying tyranny in that way. <br /><br />I know it is not so.<br /><br />Our world is filled with peaceful, loving people, people with deeply compassionate hearts.<br /><br />When I practice Zazen on the street, people seem warmed by this example. These are the people I witness on behalf of.  These are the people who need support. We cannot sustain love in a world filled with messages of hate, greed, and delusion.  Countermeasures are necessary.  In Zen we understand these to be love, generosity, and wisdom.<br /><br />If we want a world, public or private, to be serene and compassionate, then we must be serene and compassionate.<br /><br />Zazen is the practice of serene reflection, a practice rooted in silent illumination on a cushion, then rising into the world.  Please consider joining me in this practice.<br /><br />Be well.
