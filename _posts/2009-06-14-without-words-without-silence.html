With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Case 24 of the Gateless Gate is always instructive for us. In Senzaki's concise version, a monk asks Fuketsu:<br /><br />"Without speaking, without silence,<br />how can you express the truth?"<br /><br />Fuketsu observed,<br /><br />"I always remember springtime in southern China. <br />The birds sing among innumerable kinds of fragrant flowers."<br /><br />Like many koans, this approaches a key issue in Zen.  How do we express the truth?  Words? Silence?  Neither are acceptable as both are prone to spin and distortion, neither is the truth, just a representation of perception.<br /><br />Fuketsu answers weakly, though he is pointing us in a direction.  His answer is weak because it is a copy of something he has heard, an old Chinese poem. A better answer, if he were in the outhouse, would have been a fart.<br />The truth is what we are just now. The truth is not our words, not our silence, but our manifestation of ourselves. <br /><br />If Fuketsu were amid those birds, and they were chirping, his answer would be exactly on point.  Today, we are so often off point, as we speak from history, conceptualization, prognostication: from everywhere but here.<br /><br />What is Buddha?  My coffee is cold.<br /><br />Be well.
