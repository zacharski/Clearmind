With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone.<br /><br />"Show me a piece of paper with only one side!"  Matsuoka-roshi would sometimes ask my Teacher, Hogaku-roshi.  He in turn, put it to me. Forget a mobius strip...you can see both sides of the strip.  Forget "sides" Sides will just get in the way.  This is similar to the one-hand clapping koan.<br /><br />Koan work, though not a primary teaching method in Soto Zen, is still actually used by Soto Masters.  Master Dogen has an entire collection he used in a lessor known work called "Mana Shobogenzo"  and the Shobogenzo itself, is a collection of koan seeds.<br /><br />What is a koan?<br /><br />It is NOT a riddle.  It is not a puzzle. A koan is a nut, or better yet, a fruit, to peel and bite into.  The only way to "solve" a koan is to actually eat it.<br />We cannot realize a koan through the intellect. It is non-conceptual. We can answer koans only through intuitive slight of hand.<br /><br />In Soto Zen we sit with no purpose whatever.  Yet we deliberately take our seat. A koan arises. Deliberation requires an intent. Shikantaza (to just sit) denies intent. <br /><br />We vow not to kill, but kill to live.  Life itself is a koan.<br /><br />Answer, please.<br /><br /><br />Be well.
