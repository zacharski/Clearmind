With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Each morning we open our eyes only to close them again.  Like Sisyphus, we roll the stone up the hill, but to have it slide back down, yet compelled we are, to push it back up.  Albert Camus thought this was absurd. <br /><br />He was incorrect. .<br /><br />Its not getting the rock to the top of the hill that is important, nor is it actually opening our eyes.  What is important, it seems to me, is we are living--in-process. Living is what we do and living requires repetition, breath in, breath out, food in, crap out. What is the quality of our living?  Forget your goals, for a moment, those god-awful grade cards, and concentrate on your life in this very breath. I am bathed by cricket sound, the soft sigh of Tripper on a zabuton in the Zendo, and the delicious cool morning air coming in from the desert through my window.  This is the quality of my life just now.<br /><br />If our goal is to get to the sun, big problem.  Even if we could, that goal would kill us.  On the other hand, if our aim were to follow the sun, our day would be illuminated and just think of the things we might discover in the light.<br /><br />Just because the sun sets only to rise again, does not mean what we saw along the way was for naught.<br /><br />Be well.
