With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />In the silence of early morning, zazen tends to be still and easy, except for Tripper wanting to cradle his twenty old pounds into my cosmic mudra. We sit together. It is good.<br /><br />Zazen is not always so pleasant. <br /><br />Yet, pleasant and unpleasant are part of the training.  To be completely present in both, seeing through them to expose their true nature: this is zazen. In such a sense, there is no good zazen or bad zazen.  Just zazen.<br /><br />So, the point is in the training: disciplined spiritual practice. The bell rings, we sit. Food is prepared, we are cognizant of its value and its sacrifice. We go to the bathroom and are aware and grateful that everything works as it is intended...and when it doesn't, we are grateful for that awareness and the physicians and medical professionals who are there to heal us.<br /><br />As we see, Zen Training is in every moment. <br /><br />This is the most important point.  The universe does not offer you anything, there is no you.  The universe offers itself to itself.  When self awareness becomes universal awareness: infinite serenity.<br /><br />Be well.<br /><br />On a personal note:  My Little Honey will be travelling to Ohio for her 45th college reunion today.  She will be gone a week.  I expect massive parties at my house. ;)  Actually, I expect nothing.<br /><br />streetZen today at 4:00 PM at Veteran's Park!<br />Harvey So Daiho Hilbert-roshi<br />On the web at: <a href="http://www.clearmindzen.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.clearmindzen.org</a><br />Telephone: 575-405-8522
