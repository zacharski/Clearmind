With palms together,<br />Good Afternoon Everyone,<br /><br />Obon Sesshin will be Friday at 7:00 PM through Sunday at 12:00 PM July 10-12.<br /><br />Sesshin will be held at our Refuge in Cloudcroft.  If the weather does not permit, I will seek an alternative site, perhaps at Dharma Mountain Zendo. <br /><br />We ask for $25.00 donation. All meals are vegetarian.<br /><br />Please reply as soon as possible with your reservation.<br /><br />Be well.
