With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />This morning's light is softly diffused by clouds behind the eastern mountains. I see a crescent moon and Jupiter  I hear our drip system as the water flows out to the plants.  I smell my two dogs as they lay near me on the bed.  It is a delicious, soft, moment.<br /><br />Everything is in relation to everything.  This means there are things and there are no things. When we see things, we see with relation; when we see no things, we see in pure, seamless, existence. Systems and subsystems are constructions of an organizing brain.  No brain, no systems.<br /><br />Its a beautiful universe if we leave it alone and see it as it is. Some of us find beauty in discriminating patterns; others find beauty in the largest pattern, which is to say, no pattern at all. These are the dependent co-arising truths of Zen. <br /><br />Be well.
