With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />As our work week begins, may we each approach our work as a spiritual activity, that is to say. an activity of mindful practice. Our daily lives, including our work, are a laboratory for I-Thou, I-It examination.  Do we approach things as things without value, merit, or dignity? Do we treat the bus driver with the same respect as out rabbi or priest?  When we touch the keys of our computer are we experiencing the universe and at the same moment plastic?<br /><br />Spirituality is nothing more than awareness of life in its entirety.  We cannot shut out this, open that. Everything is necessary.  Everything has a purpose. Our, perhaps unique, position as human beings is that we can come to a place where we are able to experience this.<br /><br />Respect, contrary to opinion, is not earned, it is given.<br /><br />Be well.
