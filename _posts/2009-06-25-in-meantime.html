With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Contemplating a blank page<br />contemplating one's self. <br />We paint temporary pictures with words:<br />once drawn, no longer true.<br /><br />Moving, changing, evolving:<br />these are words with ground. <br />Without ground,<br />no such thing.<br />So, what is ground? <br /><br />The philosopher speaks<br />nonsense. <br />Go to the bathroom.<br />Flush the toilet.<br /><br />Be well.
