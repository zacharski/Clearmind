With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />A late start this morning caused by a difficult night. It seems I was constantly awakened by various things, usually Tripper, who has taken recently to whining a lot rather than jumping up onto the bed. I think Pete-kitty nailed him a time or two on the leap and that did him in.  Pete-kitty likes to sleep either in my arms or at my feet. Woe to any who approach in the night.<br /><br />So, I see it is morning and once again I am awake.  Rather like Groundhog Day around here.  The mountains remain.  The sky is beautiful. Judy is anxious.<br /><br />When life is life as it is, we just live. Which is to say.  Take a breath, take a step.  Sip your tea. Eat your breakfast.  Do your work.<br />Nothing special.  And when life is extraordinary?  Take a breath, take a step.  Sip your tea. Eat your breakfast.  Do your work.<br /><br />I so much enjoy Master Dogen's Instructions to the Cook.  He reveals an approach to living that is grounded and measured.  It is deliberate, even when planning.  It is discriminating.  Which is to say, every grain of rice, every vegetable, regardless of its condition, has a purpose. We must sort.  We must do. Our judgements are to assign meaning, not to take away value. Our lives should be real, one step at a time, fully and wholly lived.<br /><br />OK.  So, when anxious, recognize your anxiety. Take a breath.  Take a step.  When depressed, recognize your depression, Take a breath.  Take a step.  The ultimate medicine is engagement.<br /><br />So, Master SleepyHead recognizes his sleepiness.  He will slow down a bit.  He will sip some caffeine.  And a little later, he will take a nap.  Nothing special.<br /><br />Be well.<br /><br />PS.  Student Aejin, it was so good to see you in chat this morning!  Say hello to Hong Kong for me!
