With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Profound is like a bell only because we are a species of dullards.   It is actually quite ordinary.  A person who walks with deliberation, mindfully placing his feet on the ground, mindfully opening a door, or slicing a tomato, is deeply and profoundly there.  There is something very wonderful about the feel of a sharp knife cutting through a tomato.  The smell of an onion's juices being diced, or the smooth sheen of a dining room table as it is being polished.  Wonderful, but not special.<br /><br />If we allow our mind to create fictions of later and earlier, we are asleep as we do these things, and miss their everyday wonder.<br /><br />As a species, we are very bright, able to penetrate the absolute reality of our universe. Creative, we improve our universe, lengthen our lives, and vegetate in front of televisions. Eyes closed and unschooled to discovery, we slug back drinks that dull our minds, inject ourselves with chemicals and escape this very moment of our lives. Yes, a species of dullards.  Dangerous dullards at that.<br /><br />Zen is said to be very boring by some.  Careful!  Only those who are dullards can say that!  There is nothing boring about infinity.  Nothing boring about the present.  Take a course in life appreciation, practice zazen.<br /><br />Be well.
