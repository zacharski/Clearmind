With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />streetZen this morning after a walk with friends.  It is the 4th of July and we celebrate independence from tyranny.  The only true tyranny is the tyranny of mind, however.  Mind that designs traps; mind that establishes problems; mind that resides in thought: this is the mind of tyranny.<br /><br />Become independent of that mind.  Reside in the experience of interdependence.<br /><br />1,2,3 is not 1,2,3; it is 1,2,3. What is the difference?  Experience one and many simultaneously; let go of one; let go of two.<br /><br />The soil receives the rain water, but does not keep it.<br /><br />Happy Days,
