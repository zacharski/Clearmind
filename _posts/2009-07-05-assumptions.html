With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />This morning My Left Hand showed itself again.  I weed whacked the small patch of grass My Little Honey left last night with our new weed whacker.  This paralysis thing is always just a little twisted.  Sometimes I can get get my fingers around something and sometimes I can't.  It appears always that the assumption is I cannot do something. Bad assumption for a person with a disability.  We must assume we can, then set about finding a way to get it done.<br /><br />I also started two holes for my tomato plants.  Just now they are not large enough, but they will get bigger. And when I raked up the cut grass, I saw patches that need whacking.<br /><br />Disability can create either mindful practice or insane frustration. When I assume I "should" be able to do something "like everyone else" its frustration.  When I set about doing it with a beginner's mind, with no expectations, no "how it should be dones", its an excellent practice and a practice prone to innovation.  It just might look a little odd. <br /><br />So, the next time you go into a public bathroom and see someone with their right foot pressing down a faucet with an automatic shut-off, no worries. It could be me washing my hands.<br /><br />Be well.
