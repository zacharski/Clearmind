With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />A little while ago friends Allen and Eve walked with me as I jogged 1.5 miles of hills.  I did this sort of in-place jogging, enough to break a sweat and really enjoy myself.  At home, I did a few different upper body weight exercises, including push ups, then stretched out with a few minutes of yoga.   I woke late today, missed writing practice and zazen, but am catching up now.<br /><br />Sometimes life would be out of sync if we had sync to begin with.  No sync, nothing to be out of: when hungry, eat, when sleepy, sleep.  Or so I sometimes say.  Zen is like that.<br /><br />Here you are.  Zen practice, says Kyogen, is like a man hanging in a tree by his teeth over a cliff.  In the ravine below, a man asks him, "Why did Bodhidharma come to China from India?"  If the man in the tree does not answer, he fails.  If he answers, he falls and loses his life. So, what should he do? (Case 5, the Gateless Gate).  Always between a rock and a hard place; the devil and the deep blue sea: that's Zen.<br /><br />I hear the water falling in my pond.   My gate needs to be fixed.  A friend needs a ride. To let go is to live.<br /><br />Be well.
