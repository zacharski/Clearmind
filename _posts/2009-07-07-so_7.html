With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />So, a student enters a training center and says, "please teach me."  The Teacher asks, "Have you finished eating?"  The student says, "Yes." The Teacher replies, "Go wash your bowl!"<br /><br />Case 7 offers us a direct teaching.  Very important; deeply profound.  Most of us we want teachers to teach us with fantasies of mind.  We want our heads filled with thoughts, as if to say, thoughts are the universe. We want to feel smart, philosophical, poetical, artistic, social, loving, etc. We think we can think ourselves into this way of being.<br /><br />Zen is far more economical: go wash your bowl.<br /><br />What more is there to teach?<br /><br />Be well.
