With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />The morning light seems to rise from the ground, and while it is beautiful, it means nothing in itself.  Dark and light are the same. Nirvana and samsara, heaven and hell, good and bad: same-same.  When we behold beauty, we behold ugliness. Beauty excludes ugliness and thus becomes ugly. A good that excludes bad, excludes itself.  If heaven excludes hell, then heaven is hell. Do you understand?<br /><br />Live in your world.  Embrace your world. Seeking bliss is like seeking a narcotic; its use excludes us from being awake. The same with peak experiences.  Peak experiences are to be avoided; they separate us from the everyday. Avoid feeling good; avoid feeling bad: reside in the great middle of each moment and be authentic in that residence.<br /><br />Practice Zazen. Eat life. Share your food.<br /><br />Be well.
