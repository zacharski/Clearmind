With palms together,<br />Good Afternoon Everyone,<br /><br />This morning we taught Zazen to about forty children at Peace Village at the Unitarian Universalist Church here in Las Cruces.  We will visit with them each morning for two weeks.  I am assisted by Student Reba Zhen Shan Montero.   The period began with a song focused on peace and then instruction of seated Zen practice.  We had them sit for five minutes then offered an opportunity to talk about their experience.  As the days pass, we will increase the length of time and add walking meditation.<br /><br /><br />Peace Village children, I have found over the four years I have been doing this, are very open to the practice of Zazen.  The key is to keep the periods short and offer opportunities to talk.  The wiggle worms eventually settle down.  And most children seem interested enough to practice with a certain amount of diligence.  Not correcting or judging is also important.  I like to think of their time in the sanctuary zendo as a stress-free, settle-in time. The kids seem quite responsive and this always makes for a great volunteer experience.<br /><br />If anyone has had any experience with the Peace Village I would like to hear your stories!<br /><br />Be well.
