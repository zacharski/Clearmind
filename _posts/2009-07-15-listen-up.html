With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />This morning we practiced Jewish meditation at Peace Village, chanting a variant of the "Sh'ma".  I replaced, "Hear, O Israel" with "Listen up, Everyone!"  The children seemed to respond well to the chanting.<br /><br />Personally, I am not a mantra sort of practitioner.  I enjoy silent illumination.  But then, perhaps that's a pretty good reason to do something different.  Daido Loori-roshi often suggests that we should move away from that which we know or are comfortable with to that which is uncomfortable.  If we are "good" at shikantaza, perhaps a koan or two is in order.  So, sitting there, chanting "Listen up, Everyone, the Lord is our God, the Lord is one" was a useful departure from my norm.<br /><br />This afternoon at 4:00 PM: streetZen at Veteran's Park and Meditation at Temple Beth El at 6:00 PM.<br /><br />May you each be a blessing in the universe.
