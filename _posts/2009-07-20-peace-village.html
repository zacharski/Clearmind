With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />This morning we will begin our second week of Peace Village here in Las Cruces, New Mexico.  I am looking forward to sitting with bundles of wiggle worms.  I am honored to be asked yearly to return to teach these children.  Every year it is actually a delight and an affirmation of our society's commitment to peaceful living. <br /><br />It is not important that everyone believe this, in fact, believe nothing.  The thing that is important is that we do.<br /><br />Practicing peace is a precious gift to the universe.  It involves a lot of inner work:  A willingness to stop;  a willingness to not act when we are chomping at the bit to do so, and a willingness to allow another her point of view and see it's value.<br /><br />Children can learn to be still.  They can learn to mouth the words of peace, but they need parents and communities who are willing to walk that walk. Peace Village creates an opportunity to do just that.<br /><br />May we each be a blessing in the universe.
