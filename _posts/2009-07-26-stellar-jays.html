With palms together,<br /><br />Back at my residence, down from the mountains, the air is different.  Just a little thicker, although it did rain at the refuge yesterday afternoon.  Having a refuge is a great gift.  I am periodically able to get away from the desert, enjoy some silence, or at least noise of a different kind.  Stellar Jays squawk, hummers blitz by with shrill, high pitched tones of territorial aggression, and the flag of our deck, flips a beat in the breeze.<br /><br /><br />Son Jacob and I discussed this classic koan while on the deck with the flag.  The wind moves, no, the flag moves: no, it is your mind that moves. We trailed off into wonderful tunnels of space-time.  Folding space, time itself, and the role of the perceiver. Does anything move?  What is movement if not something defined by relative relationships?   All very heady.  Not very Zen.<br /><br />Feeding the birds when the feeder was empty; this is it.<br /><br />Yet, the moment of self reference assumed in that statement, suggests I might as well be a rank amateur.  Good.  Let's sit down and abide in the universe together.<br /><br />Be well.
