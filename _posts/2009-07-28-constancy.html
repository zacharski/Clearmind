With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />The sound of the dishwasher creates a certain rhythm in the morning.  A night of family, dinner, video games, running around the house, leaves quite a mess in the morning.  I wake to it and begin by reheating last night's coffee as I empty out the dishwasher in order to reload it with a fresh batch of dirty bowls, pans, and plates. The plants needed water: water the plants.  The dogs needed water; water the dogs.<br /><br />The occasional question creeps into mind, 'why such a mess?'  I set it aside and enjoy scrubbing out the pot, feel the hot water on the back of my hand. Drop that thought.  'And that stove?  Does Jacob always have to coat the stove with whatever he's cooking?'  Set it aside, wipe down the stove and appreciate its smooth, cool surface. Drop that thought.   <br />Practice is constant: notice, let go.  Notice, let go.<br /><br />At a point, 'notice' and 'let go' are one in the same. This is the point of no-self.<br /><br />I like to think of it as similar to beginning a run.  'Yuk!  This is no good!  I don't feel like it!'  And, as the run progresses, feet, arms, legs, lungs, heart, head, road, all seem to come together. Miles seem to slide away in perfect presence. Thusness.<br /><br />May you be a blessing today.
