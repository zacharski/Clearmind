With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br />Today is Wednesday: I will attend the Breakfast Discussion at Temple Beth-El, followed by Torah Class; I will practice streetZen at the Veteran's Park at 4:00 PM,  I will sit in meditation at Temple Beth-El at 6:00 PM, and we have a special Erev Tisha B'Av Remembrance this evening.<br /><br />I ran a 1.6 mile set of hills this morning. I was by myself as Eve and Allen got in late and Judy was sleeping so soundly I did not want to wake her.  It was good to get out there and do that.  It relieves much stress, as if I had a lot of that.  But it does allow a time for meditation in motion.  Something I have actually missed since I stopped marathon and half marathon training.  Zen in motion is what I would call a runner's high, though not quite the same.  There is no euphoria involved, just the simple presence of feet on earth and breath entering and leaving and sweat pouring out and flies buzzing around. Just being alive and in motion.  Its a very good thing.<br /><br /><br />If one day I am able to bring myself back to distance running, I am sure it will be a delight.  In the meantime, running over hills, doing short interval repeats, and casual walks in the park with wife and friends is perfect.<br /><br />May we each be a blessing today.
