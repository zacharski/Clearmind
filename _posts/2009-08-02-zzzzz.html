With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />The day has dawned in a wonderful way as it does each and every morning.  How could it not?  The sun rises with such power seemingly chasing darkness away, and things that were awake go to sleep as things asleep, wake. Being awake is not the same. Knowing there is sleep.  Knowing there is awake. These are dualistic notions.<br /><br />Being awake comes before it.<br /><br />As U2 chants, its the "street with no name."<br /><br />I wish to stop this incessant naming of things.  Pointless deviancy, it is.  To live without names, live without assumptions, live here, now, that's the thing!<br /><br />But then, along comes a bee.  ZZZZzzzzzzzzz.  What is the sound of one bee stinging?<br /><br />Awake!<br /><br />Be well.
