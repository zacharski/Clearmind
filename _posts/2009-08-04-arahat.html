With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Some of us just need to be somewhere. We are not satisfied with where we are.  Biting an apple is just not the same unless we bite that apple as an "Awakened" one, yet the moment we do, we clearly are asleep.  Practice realization is not good enough. Zen is not good enough.  Some of us have to pronounce our enlightenment. As Daniel Ingram and his derivative, Kenneth Folk,  says, "I'm an Arahat". Perhaps.<br /><br />If you are a student of Zen, a member of the Zen tradition, you let these thoughts drop away. Master Seung Sahn says, "put it down!" <br /><br />Just bite the damned apple and move on.<br /><br />Our practice, that is to say, Soto Zen practice, is a practice of engagement.  This engagement is outlined in our precepts and bodhisattva vows. Enlightenment is not a goal, it is a way of being that requires practice and moment-to-moment renunciation of self-interest. Seeking enlightenment is not the same as having 'the thought of enlightenment" as Dogan suggests in his Shoshogi:<br /><br />"[18] To arouse the thought of enlightenment is to vow to save all beings before saving ourselves.  Whether lay person or monk, whether a deva or a human, whether suffering or at ease, we should quickly form the intent of first saving others before saving ourselves."<br /><br />Master Dogen points out clearly that our actions are toward the benefit of others, other's enlightenment, not our own.  So this way of being, the buddha way, is a practice of enacting this vow.<br /><br />Let us practice together, and let the need to be enlightened go.<br /><br />Be well.
