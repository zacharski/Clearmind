Unfortunately, the moonset became obscured by clouds, but the clouds' presence in the sky made for an awesome view of the sun rising over the mountains here in Las Cruces.<br /><br />Life seems to work that way. Look one way, clouds obscure; look another, clouds become a dreamscape. Same clouds, different view. Here's the Zen: appreciate the clouds regardless of the view.<br /><br />Be well.</div>
