Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />When we talk about compassion we mean well. But compassion is not a thought. It cannot be articulated. Compassion is being. It is our complete buddha nature as it is. Talk about it takes us away from it, creates a dualism between this and that...as all talk seems to do.<br /><br />Step into your day with the compassion on a deep knowledge of your oneness with everything. Touch the floor with your foot as if you are touching yourself, because you are. Listen to your boss or your partner or your children as if they were yourself because they are. Avoid stepping on that ant on the sidewalk. Offer a cup of tea to a friend, pay for a stranger's dinner at a restaurant, visit a hospital or nursing home and say hello to someone who is suffering there.  For there we are as well.<br /><br />Compassion is so easy to talk about, so challenging to be.Practice helps.<br /><br />May you be a blessing in the universe.
