With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />The morning sun is already hard at work building the temperature of the day.  A clear blue sky offers a perfect and serene sea for the sun's journey. The water warms.<br /><br />We morning people, up at 4:30, witness a spectacular transformation. Sitting in the zendo, an ominous black, lightens. Outside on the morning walk, grey becomes pale blue.  Sitting at my desk to write the pale blue becomes a brilliant sea for the sun to lead us along our way.<br /><br />Storytellers use such drama to unfold their tales.  I wish I could tell stories, but then again, perhaps I do.  The stories of a life looked deeply into. Like water, they are sometimes pooled in the sand in full view.  Sometimes deep in dark wells with cold stone encapsulating it. <br /><br />My stories are living tales of mindful moments. Most likely boring, sometimes a little odd, but always there, a reflection in a pail of gathered water, being served up for you.<br /><br />May we each have such pails of mindful reflection.  Poured together they become the river of our human life.<br /><br />Let's share.<br /><br />Be well.
