With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br />The time is 4:56.  I have been sitting in my small zendo for a half hour, with the exception of the time it took to get the coffee pot going.  In another half hour I will get up from this cushion and go for a walk/run, then clean the kitchen, then go to streetZen, then go to services at Temple Beth -El.  This afternoon, I need to prep my classes for Sunday's Academy. And this evening a special havdalah service at White Sands National Park.<br /><br />All are just one thing in front of another.  Some may happen, some may not: no worries.<br /><br />Some of you wrote to me about my equanimity. Thank you.  This duck has mastered floating a long time ago. Yet, still occasionally he gets his feathers all a-fluff. Like any bird, though, in the blink of an eye, all feathers are back in place.<br /><br />When our feathers are in place, our mind follows.<br /><br />Be well.<br /><br /><br /><br />Harvey So Daiho Hilbert-roshi<br />On the web at: <a href="http://www.clearmindzen.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.clearmindzen.org</a><br />Telephone: 575-405-8522
