With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />If we say we have the potential to be or that we strive to be, in effect we are saying we are becoming.  These are the pleas of buddhas hooked on dualism. There is no becoming, no trying. These are the drugs of Small Mind.  Quit!  Get clean!  Sober up!<br /><br />What is left?<br /><br />Everything as it is.  No striving, no separation. Not perfect?  What is perfection but a creation of a dualistic mind seeking non-dualism?<br /><br />What is left?<br /><br />Doing.  Being.  Buddha Nature.<br /><br />The Six Perfections aren't goals; they are our reality.  Trying to be our reality denies us that reality. Becoming is an obstacle to being. <br /><br />The Infinite teaches us to be awake.  Every stone in the road.  Every sudden noise.  Every rainbow.  Every thunderclap. Every Other.  A cacophony of mindfulness bells being invited to ring.  We have but to listen.<br /><br />Be well.
