With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Over the next three mornings we will host a garage sale at our home. Goodness.  I don't look forward to this process.  My Little Honey, however, has been working diligently to make this happen.  She does so much for me and for "us".  I pale in comparison, not that we should make comparisons.<br /><br />Appreciation for those who are close to me and who love me is not a difficult challenge for me, expressing it is. I am awkward with warm, fuzzy expressions, choosing almost always to be silent when I feel overwhelmed by the help and love of others. The problem is, of course, that people need to feel appreciated and struggle when they are not.<br /><br />For me, I think the issue involved is vulnerability to emotion.  I feel vulnerable when I express a soft, warm, and fuzzy feeling.  When I express gratitude to another human being its as though I must put up my guard.  Their goodness opens me up to feelings.<br /><br />Lately especially, I have noticed a rise in my anxiety. Vulnerability is problematic.  Yet here it is: life.<br /><br />Recognizing and being willing to express appreciation to those who care for us is critical to healthy relationships.  I find it easy to appreciate the earth, the grocery store, farmers, cooks, and gas stations.  I am working on expressing my appreciation to my family.<br /><br />May this note be a first step.<br /><br />Be well.
