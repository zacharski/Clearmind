With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />If I say, as characters in "Star Wars" did, "...there is a disturbance in the Force," I believe I am saying that the balances between the good and the bad are tilted, things are askew, if you will.  At first, when the film first came out and I was a young man, I saw this as very Zen-like. But that is a poor understanding.  The Force can have no "disturbance": Buddha-nature is what is, completely empty of substance, yet pervasive. Our unenlightened characters go about, then, attempting to restore balance to the Force. Much like proselytisers of any faith tradition, they go forth to straighten out those who are bent.<br /><br />Yet, in the Judeo-Christian tradition, God (the Infinite) is quoted as saying, "I am the Lord and there is none else, I form light and create darkness, I make weal and create woe..." (Is. 45:6-7).  The enlightened bodhisattva, Isaiah, is pointing out a foundational truth of the Universe: it contains everything. Hmmm, buddha-nature pervades everything, is everything, and this includes the dark side as well as the light side much like the Dao. <br /><br />This is foundational, but really unimportant.  Buddha-nature is what it is.  What is important, actually essential and critical, is our response to it. If there is ever a "disturbance" it is interior and within us. It arises when we loose sight of the spacious mind that allows us to place in context the rumblings of narrow mind.  A proper response is equanimity, a floating, gentle embracing of what is paired with an offer to learn the practices of serene reflection meditation.<br /><br />An open hand is far more effective than a closed one. An open hand offers, but does not grasp or cling. A closed hand cannot accept and is often used to force open other closed, insecure hands. Let us each practice with this today.<br /><br />For those in the Las Cruces, NM area, I will offer an opportunity to practice meditation at Temple Beth-El from 4:00 to 4:30.  We follow meditation with yoga for beginners from 4:30 to 5:30.  Everyone is welcome.<br /><br />Be well.
