With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Dishes.  They wait each morning for my hands.  Lately, I have taken to washing them by hand.  Hot soapy water feels like silk.  Cold rinse water is a relief to the heat. And the drying cloth sooths both dish and skin.  Each dish a family member.  Each spoon a reminder of the sweetness added to My Little Honey's coffee. Leaning over the sink, I untuck my hips and spine, reaching upward, I feel the gentle tug in my hamstrings. Feet planted. The saltillo tile cools my heels.<br /><br />Zen in the kitchen.<br /><br />Shortly, Zen in the Zendo where incense waifs through the air, I will hear the candles burn, and the walls will become mirrors for this ancient, eternal soul. My back will arc a bit; I will slump a bit.  Patterns will form on the wall, movies will play in my head. Some student will adjust posture, and as with a dish in the kitchen, I will be made present again.<br /><br />Zen in the Zendo.<br /><br />As Master Kennett wrote, "Zen is eternal life."<br /><br />Be well.
