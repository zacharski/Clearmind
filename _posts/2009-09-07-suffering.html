With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Last night son Jacob invited us to dinner at his condo. He prepared a wonderful dinner, bread, arugula and butter lettuce salad, and sole, all prepared exquisitely.  The condo was spotless, extremely well appointed, and very comfortable. I was out of my comfort zone. <br /><br />Fidgeting, I played a game of "paper toss" followed it by winning a chess game on my iPhone.  I wandered around looking at his pictures and books.  My Little Honey and Jacob talked and talked.<br /><br />The other night we had dinner at a friend's.  At the dinner table, I checked my email on my iPhone.  One of my friends asked me to please put my iPhone away.  Interesting. She was right, of course, and others have made comments about my inattentiveness at functions. If its not the iPhone, its wandering, if not wandering, its meditating.  Something has changed.<br /><br />It wasn't all that long ago that I wouldn't be caught dead owning and using a cell phone,  when people commented that I was so 'alive' and it was a challenge to pull me away from people. For all my talk of being in the moment, being mindful, and being compassionate, I am very far away.<br /><br />Maybe its a phase.  Maybe I am adapting.  Maybe its all the drugs I have to take. Maybe I am bored. Maybe, maybe, maybe. I wish I knew.  I read last night about a couple of rabbis.  One asks, "Who am I?"  The other replies, "Who is asking?"<br /><br />What I know is this: I practice.<br /><br />The Buddha taught:<br /><br />Whoever sees suffering, sees the making of suffering, the ending of suffering, and the path that leads to the end of suffering. <br /><br />Whoever sees the making of suffering, sees suffering, the end of suffering, and the path. <br /><br />Whoever sees the end of suffering, sees suffering, the making of suffering, and the path. <br /><br />Whoever sees the the path that leads to the end of suffering, sees suffering, the making of suffering, and the end of suffering.<br /><br />(the First Turning of the Wheel of Dharma sutra).<br /><br />Be well.
