With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Going out into the world, going inside, good grief!  Enough going.  I practice not-going. Practicing not-going is to practice Zen. Everything is here now: no path, no attainment, no 'other shore'. <br /><br />Of course, sometimes "I" "go", as in playing iPhone games, wandering around looking at things, diving into Torah or the Sutras, etc., yet, this is just the shift of an eye, isn't it. One "eye" says "this is relative to that", suggesting two.  Another "Eye" says "this and that are one and seeing a 'this' and a 'that' is a delusion, a mortal mind-trick".  The Infinite is constantly demanding of us, "Where are you?!"<br /><br />Watch out for shifty eyes.<br /><br />Practice not-going and witness an eternal Eye.<br /><br />Be well.
