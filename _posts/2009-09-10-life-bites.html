With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br />Zen is neither mine nor yours.  Awareness is neither mine nor yours.  This moment is neither mine nor yours. Awakening is neither mine nor yours.  Mine and yours have no place in the world of Zen. Even place itself does not exist. Mine and yours are convenient fictions we live by. We give them legal sanction, moral sanction, and sometimes even spiritual sanction. So: Everything is no thing. <br /><br />Yet, a mosquito has bitten the back of my knee and it itches. At 4:30 AM Tripper barks and Judy grumbles. Our water is hard and leaves a residue on our glasses.  No thing is everything.  <br /><br />We can say these do not exist, that mine and yours, like I and Thou, are based on constructions of a mind created through a neural net. But we live within this net. When our net collapses: so collapses mine and yours. So collapses mosquito, bite, itch, dishes, Tripper's bark.  So collapses I and Thou.<br /><br />Zen is living in both with full awareness of both and acting accordingly.<br /><br />Be well.
