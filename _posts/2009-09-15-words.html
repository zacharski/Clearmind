With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />The meaning of words, goodness, they form such peculiar common ground.  A word is a vocal symbol for something. To the degree to which we share an understanding of the symbol determines the degree to which we understand each other. The rub is that understanding is never pure.  It is always distorted by our prior experience and memory of that experience. Moreover, the symbol itself has an often unspoken social meaning.  It all gets so convoluted.  Yet, we think we understand each other.<br /><br />Sometimes shared agreement on a meaning is reached.  What becomes important is the shared agreement, not the word.  The word is just a trigger, so to speak, which fires up recall of the underlying shared meaning. But even this is not the thing itself.<br /><br />Just because we share an understanding of something and the common words pointing to it, does not mean we are in actual touch with that thing.  In such cases, shared meaning clouds our mind and we think we are in touch, but are only touching a cloud.<br /><br />So a word is a symbol that points to something, but is not the thing.  A meaning is something, a thought or belief, we assign to a word or an experience. And because each of these are thought processes, they are dualistic, produced as a result of sensory data being processes by a brain that sees itself apart from that which it perceives. Its all just chemical and electrical processes that dupe us.<br /><br />So what is this?  What is a cup or a foot or a computer? What is love, compassion, hate, distortion?  These are words pointing to something, but not the things themselves. To uncover the truth we must set aside what we think we know, drop our baggage, and take the next step totally naked. <br /><br />I'm getting a headache.<br /><br />I take an aspirin.  Simple.  Not complicated.  Zen.<br /><br />Be well.
