With palms together,<br />Good Afternoon Everyone,<br /><br />Today has been very interesting.  It began with an early 4:30 rise, zazen, and putting together an outline for a workshop on "Compassion Fatigue" for a local hospice organization. I managed to get in a short 1.5 mile walk through the desert park with friends Eve and Allen, but had to leave early to get to the hospice in time for the workshop at 8:00 AM<br /><br />From there to the Temple to hear the finish of a discussion on the differences between the Christian "Old Testament" and the Hebrew Scriptures. On thing that came out:  Jews are most interested in asking questions, Christians seek to find answers.  As an aside, my sense is that Zen Buddhists just want to live as fully as possible. Scripture is relatively unimportant in Zen; it's the practice that is the Way and through the practice, the "scripture" reveals itself in our own original face.  <br /><br />Anyway, compassion fatigue, for those who don't know, is a potential condition arising from prolonged work with suffering.  We used to call it "trauma by proxy" or "secondary trauma" when I was a clinician.  Its a troublesome phenomena that can affect both an individual and an organization.  It mimics post traumatic stress disorder in many ways and is an extreme form of burn-out. <br /><br />Many Buddhist practices can be helpful in dealing with this.  Practices like tonglen, zazen, and mindfulness practices as taught by the Buddha in his Four Establishments of Mindfulness sutra can be very helpful.  Working to know our limits and establishing boundaries are also helpful.  I have found that the basic practice of shikantaza to be the most helpful to me. This is the practice of "just sitting" wholeheartedly hitting the mark. No props, no breath counting, no watching the breath: just sitting. Developing the discipline of this practice is key.  We are faced with ourselves, our thoughts and feelings, our internal 'movies' and so on, yet we just sit.<br /><br />This is helpful as it develops the ability to be present in the presence of whatever.  We do not take in and keep anything.  We take it in and let it go. We become porous and Teflon like at the same time.  The value is that we can be present with another's suffering without making it our own.<br /><br />While this is a great skill, even harder, it seems to me, is the skill of appropriate response.  I can be present.  I can float like a duck.  But I confess, I am often lost in exactly how to respond...especially with words.  I would almost rather remain silent. <br /><br />Sometimes this is good.  Other times silence is not so good.  Practice.  Practice. Practice.<br /><br />Be well.
