With palms together<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />This evening we practice for peace together in support of the United Nations International Peace Day at Temple Beth-El.  A number of local religious groups (including Clear Mind Zen)  have come together, created an interfaith choir, and will offer songs, prayers and chants in support of peace.   The event begins at 7:30 PM here in Las Cruces. <br /><br />To honor this day I will practice streetZen at the Veteran's Park at 10:00 AM.  If any of you are available and are interested please join me.<br /><br />May you each be a blessing in the universe.
