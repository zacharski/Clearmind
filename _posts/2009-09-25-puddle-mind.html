With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />An early morning chill in the air adds a sense of freshness to the day. Crisp air feels clean and clear.  A mind must be chilled as well to be clear.  One of the "kleshas" is "passion".  The connotation is heated, stirring, rolling, as the surface of the surf when water is pushed and pulled to form a tumult of waves at the beach.  Zen mind is the mind of pond or, better, puddle and residing in stillness.<br /><br />Chill: to settle down, abide in the moment as it is. <br /><br />When chill when we let the passion flow without resisting it.  Recent rain storms here in the southwest have demonstrated the futility of trying to channel the flow of raging water storming down from the mountains. When passions meet an obstacle, they tend to find a way to roll over it, around it or undermine it.  As a hardwood tree in a hurricane, if the obstacle refuses to bend with the wind, away it goes.<br /><br />How to we become mind like puddle?<br /><br />Flexibility seems to play a part.  Yoga practice teaches us to relax into an asana.  Stillness seems to play a part.  Zazen teaches us to be still even when we cry.  Being present seems to play a part. Watching water as it flows to the lowest place and there residing in stillness teaches us to let go of our idea of self-importance as we touch the Infinite when we touch the earth.<br />Be a pond?  Be a puddle?  Your response should be informative.<br /><br />Be well.
