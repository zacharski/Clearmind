With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />A sore throat and sniffles greeted me this morning.  Still there from yesterday, I decided not to go out for a walk/run/bike today.  This morning Zen services at 9:00 AM; this evening Erev Yom Kippur services at Temple Beth-El at 8:00 PM. In between, a class on the sacred art of lovingkindness at 3:00 PM.  Within each moment, vast emptiness, :).<br /><br />My altar needs candles.  I had my Daughter-in-Law pick-up a bag of tea light candles a few days ago, but she has not brought them over as yet. So, I will use an old round candle nearly burnt to the quick. There is no trash, as Master Soko Morinaga says.  May each of us burn brightly and be a light to the world even to the last breath.<br /><br />Sounds awfully dark, doesn't it, last breath and all. Yet each breath is a last breath.  Each moment the universe is created and kpasses away with each cycle of our lungs, each sweep of the second hand of the clock. Going into time deeply, there is no first, no last, just this. Still dark?<br /><br />OK.  How about, there are only infinite moments. Eternal Life opens in each. As a flower with seed seeds to flower, so we open our eyes to see the Infinite. Seeing the Infinite we recognize eternity.  Recognizing eternity, where is death, where life?<br /><br />No bother. <br /><br />Our compassion and lovingkindness steps forward out of the shadow of fear.<br /><br />May we each be a blessing in the universe today.
