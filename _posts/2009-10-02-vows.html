With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Vows are inside out. We don't take a vow, we manifest a vow already there deep within us. Like a seed planted by the Infinite, life's various twists and turns till the soil around it, water it, offer it light and warmth, and there...it opens to our view. <br />I have manifested only a few vows in my life.  A vow to serve and protect the United States. A vow to follow the ways of Torah. A vow to be a partner to My Little Honey.  And a set of Bodhisattva vows.  I like to think these are consonant and not discordant. <br /><br />It is so: the core vow is that of waking up.  Being present, and seeing with a clear mind, resolves all illusion of conflict as conflict can only occur in a deluded mind, a mind divided.<br /><br />I experience buddha-mind in every moment. We are beings united without separation, yet there is you, and there is me. The golden net is our heart.  It is our heart-mind, "shin", that is the source of all vows.  Understand, in Zen, heart and mind are not two, but one. This Heart-Mind is the essential nature of the Infinite<br /><br />As we step into the world this morning, may we step with the light of our own seeds come to full bloom.
