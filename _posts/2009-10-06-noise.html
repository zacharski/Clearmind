With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Quiet pervades even in the midst of a cacophony of noise. How? Ask, what is noise? Concordant, discordant, no matter. Noise is nothing but a sensory event we assign meaning to. Some meanings are wonderful; others, not so wonderful. Yet, when we set aside our meanings and exist with the 'noise', when 'noise' is received and accepted, enfolded into ourselves, 'noise' ceases. This is stillness.  This is serene reflection meditation.  This is Zen. It is without religious assignment, yet is the heart of all religion.<br /><br />Be well.
