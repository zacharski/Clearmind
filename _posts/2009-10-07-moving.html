With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />The morning air is moving swiftly over the desert up from Mexico. I am reminded of the koan regarding the flag and the wind. Some might say the flag is moving, others say the wind is moving, still others say mind is moving.  In truth there is no "moving".  And from the point of view of the Infinite, clearly this is so. Buddha Mind is unmoving. Yet, the clock still ticks as we measure our day and if we don't get to the bank on time, our checks will bounce.  What is important about the lesson regarding "moving" is that we learn both are true at the same time: relative and absolute.  The Infinite is infinite.  It renders all concepts both full and empty. Only No-Mind can grasp this.<br /><br />Be well.
