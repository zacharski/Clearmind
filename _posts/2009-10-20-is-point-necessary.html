With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />This morning is a wonderfully cool morning.  My chess was a little better last night. And I began reading a great little book recommended by Rabbi Citrin on the Bible called, simply enough, "Who Wrote the Bible?" It offers a background on text criticism which opens a whole other dimension to Torah study.  Agenda in writing is the sleeper to the story. As in most of life, don't we seek to know "the point"?<br /><br />When we try to transfer something from ourselves to another, duality is created.  Other is separated from self. You arises.  In this separation, a point arises. Why?  Why would you give me that?  Why are you talking to me?  Why would you take that away?  Why would you tell the story that way and not this?  What does why mean?  Is is really is?  :)<br /><br />Zen Judaism asks us to be our relationship with the Infinite. We don't become it. Why questions cause separation. What questions offer exploration. When we explore our lives for the story, the point of view, the agenda, and the dramatis personae, we begin to brings things back together. <br /><br />For the sake of what are we doing the dance in the way we do it? <br /><br />Zen Judaism would say we do what we do and in the do is the Eternal.<br /><br />Be well,
