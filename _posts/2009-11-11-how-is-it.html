With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br />"When birth and death come, how do we avoid them?", Yunman was asked. And he replied, "Where are they?"<br /><br />This is from Case 166 of Master Dogen's Koan collection.  The capping verse goes, <br /><br />"In arriving, there is no abode; <br />in departing, there is no destination.  <br />Ultimately, how is it?  <br />Here I have been all the time!"<br /><br />This morning I entered the Zendo early and sat facing the wall.  I decided not to bring a timer.  I just sat. It is Veteran's Day today. We are asked to remember.  I don't think so. I cast aside memories. <br /><br />Zen is the practice of just being.  We do not practice for today, tomorrow or due to something that happened yesterday. We practice for nothing. Zen practice is a constant letting go of things we think are true, or that we believe in, or that we experience.  Sometimes it is a struggle to do so.  This morning, for example, I could not find a cat carrier we had borrowed from friends.  They asked to have it returned.  Embarrassed for not already having done so, I frantically searched for the carrier, but it is no where to be found. I knew I needed to let go of it. Stepping out of the car to walk later, I was tight as a drum.  A few words, a few steps: let go. Zen in motion.<br /><br />It is said that the past informs the future.  I say the future is a figment of our imagination.  As is the past.  When we to live in accordance with the dharma, there is no problem.  And missing cat carriers are mysteries, not avalanches. <br /><br />Be well.
