With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Those of you receiving this are what remains of my daily recipients list.  <br /><br />I have decided to step away from synagogue life, as I indicated earlier.  My focus will be on my own practice as a Zen priest and theology student.  Practice is a large matter residing in the intimate details.  Practice is where our "shin" is, our heart/mind.  <br /><br />My practice, the deepest practice of all, is zazen. <br /><br />I will post a bit more infrequently than in the past.  <br /><br />Practice periods are 10:30 Monday and Friday at Veteran's Park and at 9:00 AM at my home Zendo.<br /><br />I encourage each of you to take up this practice daily in your home. <br /><br />May you each be a blessing,
