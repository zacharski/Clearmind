With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /> <br />The dishes are put away, the dishwasher is re-loaded, my laundry is being washed, the coffee is brewed, and I am sitting just now in my Zendo. The window is open. Cool air flows onto my robed knee. It is refreshing. <br /> <br />I spent a lot of time last night just sitting. Its a wonderful way to experience no-time. Notice the language. I do not "spend" time.  I do not experience "time".  When I am "spending time" I am really not present as I am aware of the memory of one moment to the next, measuring one against another.   When I do that there an be no now.<br /> <br />But when I experience "no-time" that  is to say, I remain with the present moment, with no last moment, no next moment, no comparing, there can be no time.<br /><br />What is it like to live without time?  Boundless. <br /> <br />Be well.
