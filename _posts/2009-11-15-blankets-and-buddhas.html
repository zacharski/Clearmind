With palms together,<br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />A cold front is moving across the desert and the morning air is sitting at 43 degrees. Shortly I will bundle-up and go outside to walk.  We often say in Zen there is no hot or cold. Yet, there it is,  The relative scale of the thermometer, the need for our bodies to remain within a certain range on that scale, demand action.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Four of us sat zazen Friday in the rotunda.  The wind was blowing very hard, fallen leaves didn't just shuffle along, they absolutely ran! Each of us were forced to put on protective clothing.  Again, the relative truth of things came into play.<br /><br /><br /><br />For those of us convinced awakening frees us from such things, I say that sort of awakening is just another delusion. Air remains is both cold and not cold at the same time. Awakened beings get cold.  They then cover up. No problem.  <br /><br /><br /><br />The moment we argue with the cold or with the heat or that we should somehow be little statues, immune to it all, we lose our buddhahood,.  Master Dogen says practice is realization.  What is practice?  Doing what is there to do completely and without an alternative universe of appeal settling on our brow.<br /><br /><br /><br />Time to bundle.  Be well.
