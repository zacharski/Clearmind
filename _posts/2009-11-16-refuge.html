With palms together,<br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />Often in the morning I ask , "What am I doing?"  My answer, "I don't know." <br /><br /><br /><br />Disciple KoMyo and I talked yesterday.  During the Rohatsu sesshin, our seniors will confer.  The Order will develop itself.  For my part, I want to remain without a Zen Center.  My practice is on the street and in the heart.  My practice is about being peace. Buildings do not make for much of anything but a place to separate yourself from the everyday and in Zen, as in most spiritual practices, it is the everyday is everything.<br /><br /><br /><br />Practice in the open, under the sky, on grass or sidewalks, and in parks is precisely how Buddha himself practiced.  Today, with pace being so important and distraction being our singular human activity, we fail to learn about ourselves.  We do not stop long enough to listen. <br /><br /><br /><br />It is easy to fall prey to this.  I just did.  Its a kind of sickness, I think. The trouble is, it seems to define the contemporary human condition worldwide.<br /><br /><br /><br />Clear Mind Zen is a refuge.  To enter it is easy: simply turn off everything and just sit down and shut up. <br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
