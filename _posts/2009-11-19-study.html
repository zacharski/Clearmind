With Palms Together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /> <br />Yesterday afternnon I was reviewing the fukanzazengi, a text by Master Dogen.  I was doing this in concert with a review of Uchiyama's "Opening the Hand of Thought".  Its funny how one text often inspires the examination of another.  In Zen we have such awesome texts to look to for inspiration.  Each time I look into one, I feel compelled tpo look into another.  There is a great danger in this, however. <br /> <br />The danger, of course, is that such absorbtion points in absolutely the wrong direction. The steps we take in study should compell us to set the texts aside and seek refuge in the our Self through zazen.  Zazen is the practice, the rest are ideas about the practice.  About is not the same as is.<br /> <br />So, we use our study to inspire us to move toward practice.  Practice to get our head away from ideas. Eat our celery without it being "celery". Then study with a clear mind.<br /> <br />Be well.
