With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />This morning I woke feeling rested.  This is a  wonderful feeling, yet it will pass.  I just received an email from my walking partners.  They will not be going out this morning.  He has a sciatica problem affecting his foot.  A few days rest are in order.<br /><br />As we age we really begin to notice changes.  Not as sharp, not as strong, not as flexible, not as resiliant, we say, because we recall a time when we were otherwise.  Its easy to say, everything changes, live in the moment, and let the rest go.  Or to notice that, in the end there is no end and our True Nature is Infinite.  <br /><br />Yet, faced with an inability to walk, or a heart that needs repair, or a brain that is declining, requires a recognition of what was to what is in order to deal with what will be.  Just as the monastery's cook must have a time and a place to plan tomorrow's meal, he must also consider the contents of his pantry, the number of monastics to fed and the conditions of the economy and agriculture in his area.  So, to, we as individuals must examine and plan.  This is also "living in the moment".  <br /><br />Be well.
