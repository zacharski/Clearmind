With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Things happen.  This morning I woke a bit late, spent an hour getting a very messy kitchen cleaned (having a French Chef for a son has two sides) and took care of the animals.  From there, into the Zendo for meditation and writing practice. Bella, other son's dog, would not stop barking.  I feared Judy would wake.  Calmed Bella, began to video, then I heard the washing machine start.  Judy was up. Bella barked again. Tripper followed.  I followed Tripper. <br /><br />So, I abandoned the seat, visited with Judy, sipped coffee, and played online chess as she scanned her email.  Shortly it will be time to walk. Everything is as it is. <br /> <br />Zen in the morning.<br /><br />Be well.
