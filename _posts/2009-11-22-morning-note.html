With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />A busy night last night.  We had a party for Daughter-in-Law Maggie in honor of her completing a course to become a physical trainer.  She did her testing for her certificate, but will not know the results for a couple of weeks.  It was delightful to see the joy in her face as a cake and special dinner was presented!<br /><br />This morning Robert Yee of Robert Yee Productions, will visit us in the Zendo.  He has been following our sitting for the last week videotaping in order to produce a short video on streetZen.  The film will be a part of the Mesilla Valley Film Festival here on December 5th. I am uncertain how he will pull this off: a movie of people just sitting?<br /><br />That is his.  This is mine.  A mantra to live by.<br /><br />We also have an extra dog with us.  Zeesa, friend Deana's Labrador.  Together with our other three (we are watching son Jason's dog, as well) we are up to our hips in fur.  I am learning much about myself with these pets.  They are what they are and need what they need.  Dogs bark, chase our cat Pete, and otherwise do things that are not always appropriate.  If my mind is open, to problem, if closed, big problem.  The practice is to keep my mind open.  Thoughts in, thoughts out. That's the way.<br /><br />Be well.
