With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,  <br /><br />Sitting with someone who is suffering is very challenging.  We wish the person was not experiencing pain, we would like to relieve that pain so the person will not suffer.  Our hearts feel.  We suffer in our desire to relieve suffering.  <br /><br />What to do.  Nothing.  Zen practice is to be.  Yet, to be in a particular way.  This way of being is the way of the Buddha.  <br /><br />Increasing the space between the perceptions, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors we experience, we allow for stillness. Moving deeper in that stillness, patience.  In that patience, concentration, generosity, morality, and diligence arise.   <br /><br />Through these perfections, we see the one thing that remains: just do.<br /><br />Be well.
