With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Joy is a wonderful thing.  Eyes light-up, smiles happen, heart-rates jump, all sorts of healthful chemicals flow through our bodies. So, why shouldn't we desire it?<br /><br />Desire is one of those kleshas, those toxins we are taught in the Buddha Way to avoid.  It is equated with greed, a poison that overcomes us and disallows our awakening.  <br /><br />Sunday at our discussion after Zazen, we talked about how wanting something has been co-opted and transformed into needing something by the marketing  forces of corporations. But they are not necessarily to blame.  We, ourselves, do this simple conversion.  It is rather like the simple slip from "is" to "ought" and not actually recognizing that the two are not connected.  We human beings desire.  <br /><br />Desire in itself is not the problem.  It is what we do with it.  Recognizing desire is just like recognizing a thought or a feeling.  No problem.  Return to your breath and be still.  Increase the space between the desire and the action to obtain the object of the desire. Desire is with us always.  So?  <br /><br />When desire becomes need it becomes a "problem".  If I desire to feel good and at some point begin to "need" to feel good, I am vulnerable.  If I desire to have peace and at some point need to have peace, I also am vulnerable.  To what?  Behavior that is hurtful and harmful to self and others.  The "I" takes on such a central and obsessive role that other cannot be seen. <br /><br />So the practice is to notice and take the subtle but very important backward step into stillness. What is the Buddha Way?  The Middle Way.<br /><br />Be well.
