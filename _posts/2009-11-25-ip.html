With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /> <br />The world is still here. I did yet another sleep study last night.  This time with a CPAP for sleep apnea which I have, they say, a very mild case.  Always seeking a solution seems to suggest always seeking a problem. It is an interesting position being the Identified Patient.  Life becomes a laboratory and I become the experiment.  Observers understand everything then in terms of this or that.  Yes. And then the solutions.  Pills, machines, and, of course, more tests.  <br /> <br />These are just a bother, to use Willie the Pooh's word, the real issue is the interior landscape.<br /> <br />What is it to live as if there is a problem, an illness, a condition, underneath everything?  Behavior and thought suspect?  Framed in some pathological picture? <br /> <br />Life lived this way seems to dismiss or diminish the health of a person.  No matter what else is, illness is in the scope. <br /> <br />Zen makes it possible not to do this.  Zen takes what is, just as it is.  Removes the frame and opens the cage.<br /> <br />Fly bird, fly.<br /> <br />Alas, in the end, no where to go.<br /> <br />Be well.
