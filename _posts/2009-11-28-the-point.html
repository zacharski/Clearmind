With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Playing online chess with really good chess players around the world is an exercise in humility.  I decided not too long ago to only seek games with players ranked at exactly my rank and upward to three hundred points.  This forces me to play with very good players each game.  It also allows me to immediately (or nearly so) see my smaller errors.  One thing I've noticed is it is much easier to yield defeat after a blunder when playing someone ranked above me.  I wonder about this.<br /><br />Now, that is not the point, the point is to notice such things.<br /><br />We spend much of our lives (or at least I have) not noticing. We have our eye on future possibilities, as an Argentine opponent once phrased it. Aging, like playing vastly superior players, informs us: future possibilities are less interesting than present delights.  Noticing becomes increasingly important, I suspect.  And as we practice, we notice more easily. <br /><br />Again, not the point.  Practice for itself is the point, not for insight, not for small awakenings, not for anything we can name.  <br /><br />Just practice.<br /><br />Be well.
