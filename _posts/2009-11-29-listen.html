With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />A headline on the news services this morning spoke to me.  It reported that a storm was gathering in the US senate.  I immediately saw a senator addressing an empty chamber with other senators huddled in their offices, surrounded by staffers, looking for ways and means to sink or float whatever.  The thought occurred to me that this is an exemplar of our most serious contemporary problem: no one listens.<br /><br />We seem to run through our lives with an agenda in mind.  First, get what I want.  Second, be as distracted as is possible in the process.<br /><br />Listening requires stopping first and releasing our grip on what it is we are carrying, second.  <br /><br />Zazen is a powerful tool in learning not only that this is possible, but that it is of great benefit to do so.  When we practice zazen, we stop.  We gather ourselves together.  We take our seat with deliberation.  We address the universe as it is, not as we wish it to be.<br /><br />I have lived a great deal of my life wishing to have each moment be different than it was and I can attest to the fact that such a way is crazy-making.  Not only do we not experience anything directly as it is, but we tarnish what is with our attitudes about it.  We are like the walking dead. To be alive, we must be present.   <br /> <br />Take the backward step to life.<br /><br />Be well.
