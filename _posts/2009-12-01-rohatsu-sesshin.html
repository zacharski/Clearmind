With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /> <br />We begin our weekend Rohatsu sesshin on Friday evening and will practice a mix of zazen in the Clear Mind Zendo and streetZen both at the Veteran's Park and in Old Mesilla throughout Saturday.  A showing of an independent film about streetZen at the Fountain theatre will be considered part of our study practice on Saturday afternoon. If you wish to participate, please email me (if you have not already done so).   <br /> <br />For those attending, please bring sleeping bags, blankets, and your own cushion for streetZen.  Dress warm, layered, and in dark colors, preferably black.  Evening and early morning practice will be in the Zendo.  Late morning and throughout the day we will sit outdoors. Gloves and scarves will be needed.  <br /><br />Morning and evening meals will be indoors.  Lunch will be outdoors at streetZen.  Sunday morning we will practice in the Zendo and Student Joe Weitzell will take Jukai. <br /> <br />A small donation will be welcomed. Please join us to mark the awakening of the Buddha.<br /> <br />Be well.
