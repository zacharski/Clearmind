With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Does practice change anything?  After years of sitting facing a wall, does it at all matter that such a practice was done?  In the morning the sun rises. Has millenia of nights made a difference?  <br /><br />Under the sun, a rock.  Does the sand in the desert change or not?  Does the rock come and go?<br /><br />Does anything change anything?  Of course it does ...and it doesn't.  Buddha taught this arises because that arises in an infinite thread; birth, death, birth, death. When we say they are the same, one thing; when we say they are different, another thing.<br /><br />To live without war is easy.  Just give up the fighting and abandon the who that is doing it.   More guns, more war; less guns, less war.<br /><br />And the who that it is being done to? To live in peace is a challenge. Peace requires a willingness to take our hands off an enemy and put them back on a person who is suffering. <br /><br />Stop, Listen, Practice!<br /><br /><br />Yours,
