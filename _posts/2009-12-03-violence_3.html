With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /> <br />There is always a reason for violent solutions. Violent solutions seem quite efficient and are often in service to an emotional need. Yet, violent solutions are, more often than not, short sighted and suggest a lack of creativity, skill, and patience, to say nothing of a lack of compassion.  <br /> <br />Ruthless enemies offer opportunities for quick, violent solutions so all enemies are ruthless.  We sometimes say violence is compassionate as it can, we believe, be corrective.  Is this actually so? What is corrective about a bully? A sharp word or crack of a stick gets our attention, but isn't there a cost?  Moreover, what causes ruthless behavior? And does violence address that cause?<br /> <br />I have used guns, grenades, sharp words, and a kyosaku.  The former in service to killing an enemy and protecting my life, the latter in service to family and students. Or so I convince myself.  In Zen we are asked to always question.  <br /> <br />Is there not a better way?<br /> <br />Be well.
