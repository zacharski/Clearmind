With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />We woke to a few inches of snow on the ground. The Zendo was warm and inviting.  I opened the window a bit and as we sat, the cold morning air penetrated my samue (working clothes)  to wake up my skin.  Disciple Rev. KoMyo is here from California and sat with me this morning.  We will begin Rohatsu sesshin this evening.<br /><br />Our sesshin are weekend events.  This sesshin, typically done at our Mountain Refuge, will be done in Las Cruces at my residence' Zendo and on the street.  It will be a challenge, but then, Zen is nothing, if not a challenge.<br /><br />When we leave our comfort zone many channels of awareness open.  Even our skin seems to be on alert.  This is a welcoming invitation to experience the present moment.  <br />Too comfortable is a problem; too uncomfortable, also a problem.  To leave what we know is not to jump over a cliff.  But, it is to take a step into unknown territory.<br /><br /><br /><br />So, this sesshin will be a different experience than what we have grown accustomed to over the last several years.  If you are in the area and wish to join us, please do.  Saturday morning we will begin in the Zendo then move to Veteran's park.  In the afternoon we will be in Old Mesilla, then back to the Zendo in the evening.<br /><br /><br /><br />Lastly, a reminder, Robert Yee will be showing his independent film, "Street Zen", at the Fountain Theatre Saturday afternoon at 1:30 PM.  Part of our Study Period will involve watching this film which features members of our Sangha.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
