With palms together,<br />Good Afternoon Everyone,<br /><br />We have a very windy day here in southern New Mexico.  The swing on the back patio was lifted and thrown against the house, creating a small hole in our wall.  Looking out, looking in.  Meditation and Ygoa at TBE at 4:00 today.<br />_____________<br /><br /><br />Wind<br /><br />Tumbleweed <br />create a sangha <br />in the walled corner, <br />gathering <br />near Buddha <br />like so many disciples.  <br /><br />Dry and lifeless<br />stiff and prickly.<br />This is how they roll.<br /><br />Is this what it means <br />to be aimless? <br /><br />No.  <br /><br />Look within and see<br />the seed <br />grasping to earth <br />in a flow<br />as a handless wand <br />spreads stardust.<br /><br />A breath.<br /><br /><br /><br /> Be well.
