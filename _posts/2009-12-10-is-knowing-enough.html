With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />From the Soto Zen meal blessings, Gokan No Ge:<br /><br />First, innumerable labors have brought us this food<br />We should know how it came to us.<br /><br />The new farm:  <br /><br />"Find a sheet of printer paper and imagine a full-grown bird shaped something like a football with legs standing on it.  Imagine 33,000 of these rectangles in a grid. (Broilers are never in cages, and never on multiple levels.) Now enclose the grid with windowless walls and put a ceiling on top.  Run in automated (drug-laced) feed, water, heating, and ventilation systems."<br /><br />Free range?  Make a small opening in the wall, enough for one bird to squeeze through to a 5 x 5 foot dirt patch.  This qualifies the mass of birds to be labelled "free range".<br /><br />Now, after killing, the chickens are placed in a refrigerated water tank, thousands at a time.  Referred to as 'fecal soup' by the Government Accountability Project, clean birds are cooled with dirty ones.  Hot birds have open pores and absorb the water and "the (new) law of the land allows for slightly more than 11 percent of liquid absorption."  (Quoted from "Eating animals" by Safran Foer.)<br /><br />So its not just the labels that are apparently just 'full of shit'.  <br /><br />Consider not trusting a word, not a single word, of anything written on food packaged in the United States.  <br /><br />Be well.
