With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />This morning I would like to talk a little about what it means to follow the Buddha Way. It's a deceptively simple path to nowhere. It's a path where the path itself is the end and the beginning.  It is a Way where, "Are we there yet?", is a meaningless question.<br /> <br />More BabbleZen?  Put your hands on the table you are sitting at.  Take in a breath and release it slowly and deeply. Where are you? No BabbleZen, just being there.<br /> <br />When we are 'there', that is to say, 'here', we are able to experience nothing more or less than 'here.'  When we realize 'here' is the whole enchilada then we are free to be completely present and eat it.  We release the thought of the next moment and the last moment.  We release the grip of feelings, knowing they have very short lifespans and are simply reflections of thoughts and discriminations. <br /> <br />No planning?  No dreaming?  Not so.  We have our thoughts and our feelings, but we do not hold them tightly.  We practice knowing these things are present moments activities and we do them wholeheartedly.  What we don't do is allow let them lead us around by the nose.<br /> <br />Living Zen is living now.           <br /><br />Be well.
