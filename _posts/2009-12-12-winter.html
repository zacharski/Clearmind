With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /> <br />Winter gets a bad rep.  In some places, such as Cleveland, deservedly so. Yet, there is something of value about the winter regardless of where we are.  The day opens slowly in the winter. A good way to begin any day actually.  <br /><br />"Slow" is rarely encountered and certainly not appreciated today.  "Slow" is too often experienced as a hindrance.  We so want to 'get there'! Yet, "slow" assists us by allowing moments of thoughtful deliberation to occur, as well as time to appreciate each moment itself.  And due to our own expectations of what a reasonable pace is, to go slower than that expectation offers us a teaching about ourselves.  <br /><br />So, I know when I am in a hurry, I have taken to slowing down a bit.  Attention to breath, slowly in, slower out, reside in the center.  While I am clearly not always successful, as I do not always practice what I preach, I am always successful when I do practice.<br /> <br />Be well, be slow.
