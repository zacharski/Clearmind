With palms together,<br />Good Afternoon All,<br /><br />This morning's streetZen went well.  It was delightful outside. Colette and I were sitting alone, but a woman came by and decided to join us. She had been to the local showing of the short Yee film about me and Street Zen and decided to come by.  Such good things happen when just sitting.  <br /><br />During the first sitting period I was visited by a spider.  After the others left, I stayed for awhile and was soon visited by a curious roadrunner. The spider crawled onto my head, the roadrunner just walked behind me.  <br /><br />This afternoon I have a Study Group meeting at my residence at four.  A delightfully diverse group of participants create a truly wonderful atmosphere.  If interested, please join us.<br /><br />Be well.
