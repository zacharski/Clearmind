With palms together,<br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />Lately, I am encountering questions about the use of violence to confront violence in the world. Is Zen Buddhism pacifist?  How do we actually live out our precepts, precepts that underscore a position of doing no harm on the one hand, and doing good, on the other hand?<br /><br /><br /><br />How do we embrace those that would kill us?<br /><br /><br /><br />How do we deal with those who would have us kill?<br /><br /><br /><br />I will answer directly:<br /><br /><br /><br />I believe the Buddha Way does not embrace or support violent solutions to violent conflict.  <br /><br /><br /><br />I believe we are called to directly confront violence with non-violence and  to meet hate with love.<br /><br /><br /><br />I believe this takes a long and deep practice which results in a dropping away of self so there is "no hindrance in the mind, therefore, no fear". We are not always residing in this place, but must continue our practice so as to 'water the seeds' of our compassion.<br /><br /><br /><br />Because of this, Zen is not for everyone as very few are at a point in their human and spiritual development where such a way is even understandable, let alone possible.<br /><br /><br /><br />Is violence necessary?  I say rarely.  We are far too quick to rely on primitive and thoughtless behaviors. If someone is about to cause harm, we must prevent that harm from happening, of course  The question is how.  Violence should be the absolute last choice and only if the threat is imminent. <br /><br /><br /><br />The Buddha Way is the way of stillness in motion.  It is selfless love made manifest through every bodily organ. We practice to be walking, talking, and doing Buddhas. <br /><br /><br /><br />Yes, Zen is not for everyone. But everyone willing is welcome to come and train.<br /><br />_____________<br /><br />On a personal note, today is very interesting.  II will meet with Robert Yee, the filmmaker, and select snippets of video as well as stills that we might use on our Clear Mind Zen website to address streetZen. I also have a doctor's appointment to talk about a sleep study.  After that, PrayerWorks at Rabbi Kane's home which takes us through lunch.<br /><br /> <br /><br />In the afternoon at 4:00, it is Meditation and Yoga at TBE.  <br /><br /> <br /><br />Be well.
