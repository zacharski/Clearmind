With palms together,<br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />In spite of all the books, references, and times it is refered to as such, there is no Buddhism. For there to be a Buddhism, there would need to be a set of beliefs, a dogma, something the "-ism" would reside in.  If we seek to adopt a set of values, we are lost. If we believe in Buddha, we are lost. We must allow the sword of Manjushri to set us free.<br /><br /><br /><br />Followers of the Buddha Way take a backward step.  We sit down. We reside in stillness.  In this stillness our skins fall away allowing us to touch our True Nature, our True Body.  Say what it is, and it is no more. Hold it out as an ideal and it is as good as a stuffed animal.<br /><br /><br /><br />All that we think we know about Buddhism is delusion. We should get rid of it.  It is worse than trash, it is toxic to our practice, which is to say, it closes our eyes. To use a phrase popularized by my friend, Brad Warner, sit down and shut up and in the process, allow our eyes to open.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
