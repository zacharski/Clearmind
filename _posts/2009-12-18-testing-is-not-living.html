With palms together,<br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />When we fail our lives seem as if for nothing. Our thoughts scream, our feelings blister, and our hearts feel empty.  If failure is a pattern, we begin to think in terms of futility or a corruption of our personality, a loss of soul.  Yet, all of this is based in what?  A measure we create in the first place and hold out as if it were a litmus test of our worth.<br /><br /><br /><br />Not so.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Our test is not in our failure or our patterns, but rather in our recognition and willingness to take the next step.  Always, it is to do what is there in front of us to do.<br /><br /><br /><br />Listen to the screams,  they are our teachers. Listen to the thoughts, they are our teachers.  Listen to our feelings, they are our teachers.  Yet, none are the end point, but rather the beginning.<br /><br /><br /><br />Just so, the successes in life.  Another false measure, easy to be mistaken for the moon and not the finger pointing to it. We bathe ourselves in good feeling, positive thoughts and embrace a sense of invincibility.  Each are our teachers.  Pay attention!<br /><br /><br /><br />Things always change!  Therefore positive and negative are never infinite, but always reside on an infinite continuum. It takes a human heart/mind to assign a point on a fabricated measure in order for them to make any sense at all.<br /><br /><br /><br />Because everything changes the most important aspect of our lives is how we engage the moment we are in.  Just what is our next step, anyway?<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
