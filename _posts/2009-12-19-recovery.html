With palms together,<br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />There is no where to go that we have not been.  Yet, we always seem to seek something new.  Brain on drugs.  Every feeling, every sensation,smell, taste, touch, sound, we have experienced either directly in life or indirectly  through media. There is, indeed, nothing new under the sun, yet there it is, the next step, the next adventure, trip, meal, movie, partner.  Its dizzy making.<br /><br /><br /><br />What we avoid experiencing is stillness. Serene reflection.  Our actual self.<br /><br /><br /><br />This gives a somewhat different meaning to recovery.  Rather than seeking recovery from, we experience recovery of.  It is a deeply profound difference with very different assumptions and starting places.<br /><br /><br /><br />Our original self is our original mind, like that great void across the deep in Genesis, it is our Original Nature. We need not recover from our addictions, distractions, and other delusions, instead we take a backward step and allow them to just be what they are:  our job is to see them clearly for the nose-rings they are, for the deluded thinking they are, and for the escapes they offer. <br /><br /><br /><br />In this place of serene reflection,we release our grip on thought, we let go, and reside in our Original Nature.  Taking that next step first requires getting to a condition we call the top of a hundred foot pole. Yet here is the rub, there is no top; there is no bottom. Top and bottom are one in the same. Now what?<br /><br /><br /><br />When things are buzzing around, witness the buzz. Invite the fly out the door. No where to go; nothing to be.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
