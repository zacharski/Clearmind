With palms together,<br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />What follows is inspired by both the film, Avatar, and our weekly discussion group held at my residence.  <br /><br /><br /><br />In a world where species specific ethics is the rule, an organic system cannot sustain itself.  In a world of egocentricity, a homo sapien system cannot sustain itself. In both cases, we are on the losing side of the rule.  Sustainability requires an aim of system wide sustainability.  In Merton's words, 'no man is an island', nor, I will add, is a species.<br /><br /><br /><br />Classic theology has Man at the center of the world, if not the entire universe, and Self and the salvation of self , is the chief product and process of that creation.  It is a theology of death, yet masquerades as a supporter of life.  Adherents of this theology place everything in service to a single species and, ultimately on each human being as the crown of creation. Even our care and compassion are placed in service to our needs. <br /><br /><br /><br />Yet, no system can sustain itself without being open and interconnected to other systems. Our planet depends on such interconnectivity. Our individual lives depend on our interconnectivity to other lives.  Energy must be transferred.  We must see and behave with the heart/mind of the totality, of One.<br /><br /><br /><br />Some might call this pantheism.  Where everything is God and the universe is imbued as Its central nervous system. Some believe this means an end to a personal God.  I don't believe it is so.  It is only my need to have something like me as deity that I hold onto such a belief.  Release that need, open yourself to the entirety of life and such a egocentric need dissolves.<br /><br /><br /><br />A system large or small must maintain its equilibrium. If we look at any one part of a system as its key element, then we might understand a system's self regulatory balancing as cruel.  But sustainability is both the end and the means.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Only through a willingness to see through the eyes of the other can we understand our actual relationships to all things.  The film, Avatar, explores such themes in creative and beautiful detail.  It is a rare effort to open our heart and open our eyes to things bigger than ourselves.   What a wonderful holiday gift.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
