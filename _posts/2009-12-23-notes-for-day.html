with palms together,<br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />Waking to the patter of rain today.  The sky is clouded over.  The temperature is a chilly 37 degrees.  I am wrapped in my robe and feel content to just be here at my desk talking to you.<br /><br /><br /><br />A sense of contentment is a wonderful thing.  Very grounding.  Yet, contentment can be dangerous.  It is one thing to feel contentment for one's self and entirely another, to be content with the condition of the world in which we live.  Feeling content to me means I have little anxiety about myself, my own path, my desires, hopes and dreams.  Yet, I am a deeply malcontent-ed person as I look out into that other aspect of myself, the world. <br /><br /><br /><br />So much fear and anger in the world; so much suspicion and hate. So much disproportionate wealth, poverty, hunger, untreated sickness. And such fear about people getting what some believe they do not deserve. <br /><br /><br /><br />On one level, I would like to eliminate that word and its meaning from our language.  Deservedness, like merit, suggests undeservedness and a lack of merit.  The assignment of these values is based on duality.  I am different, separate from, you. I do (or don't do)  "x" and "deserve"  "Y".  Or "not Y".  Yet we are all of the same species, living together on an interdependent world.  We have the same needs, often start out in vastly different circumstances, but according to some, should accept the value system of the few who "own" 90 percent of the wealth. On the other hand, we are, in fact, a part of an interdependent universe and as a result each have some responsibility to offer something to the whole. My practice of late is how to come to terms with this. Everyone is important.  Everyone deserves the wherewithall to live.<br /><br /><br /><br />Maybe this time of year is a good time to examine the question ourselves. We must exercise care, though.  It is easy to think that the needs of others are there to offer us opportunities to learn compassion and resolve some guilt we may ourselves feel for the quality of our own lives.  Yet, doesn't this make the other an object to meet our needs?   Meeting the needs of others must be for the sake of others and not for ourselves. So we should approach our work with complete personal contentment and deep grounding.<br /><br /><br /><br />Just so, these holidays.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
