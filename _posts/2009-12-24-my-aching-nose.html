With palms together, <br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />My teacher often would say to me, "If I grab your nose and twist it, you would yell!"  The trouble with reaching a state of non-duality is those reaching it often believe they will reside there, should reside there, and ought to be able to reside there...forever.  Not so.  <br /><br /><br /><br />We are human beings living with a central nervous system and all of it's attendant functions.  Our senses perceive, our brain organizes, processes and responds.  Even when we realize the reality constructed by our brain is not the reality that exists as it is, we still must deal with our CNS and it's chemical and electrical processes.<br /><br /><br /><br />Creating a pause between thought, feeling, and behavior is only one step.  Some get stuck in the pause.  Believing that pause is the same as emptiness.  It is not. We must take a next step.  A next breath.  A next meal.  We must continue to function in the world.<br /><br /><br /><br />So then, what is this function?  Is it to sit in serene reflection under a bodhi tree?  Perhaps. Facing the world with a clear mind reveals function.  When angry, love. When desperately hungry, eat.  When caught in the traps of mind, practice. Our universe presents its state to us.  When we have a clear mind, we see this state and respond accordingly.  It is not a one size fits all world.  Nor is it a world we can separate ourselves from.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
