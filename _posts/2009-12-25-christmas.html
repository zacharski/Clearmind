With palms together,<br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />There are so many, many levels of understanding related to Christmas. I see them on a continuum.  On one end of the pole is Christmas as a celebration of the birth of Jesus of Nazareth who came to be called a Messiah by some and whose followers later made a deity.  On the other end of the pole is a holiday, one among many, but nothing particularly religious. In between, a vast array of meanings, each according to the person experiencing the day.<br /><br /><br /><br />Another dimension is that of like and dislike: those who go completely and gleefully nuts on one end; those who aggressively go "bah, humbug!' on the other.  This is accompanied by still another dimension, that of sacred and profane. It gets so confusing.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Someone could not believe Jesus was anyone particularly special and yet hold the secular nature of the holiday sacred!  Case in point, the response to those "bah-humbuggers" out there, which is typically, "Ah come on, its something everyone enjoys!"  or "Can't you get into the spirit of the day?!"<br /><br /><br /><br />In my own family, we have those who believe Jesus was God and those who don't.  We have those who wish the whole thing would just go away and those who delight in everything about it except its religious origin.<br /><br /><br /><br />I confess, most of the "season" I wish it would just go away.  But on the day itself, when all the craziness is said and done, I do enjoy witnessing the delight in people as they offer and receive the blessings of the day.<br /><br /><br /><br />Wherever you might be in the scatter-gram result of my ridiculous multi-dimensional analysis, I wish you some delight today even if its as simple (and as miraculous) as the delight of being able to perceive yourself in the world.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Be well.
