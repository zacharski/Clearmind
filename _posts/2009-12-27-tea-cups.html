With palms together,<br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />The day is dawning cold. I feel my body much more acutely than ever before as I age and the temperatures are low.  Those first bends and twists to feed the dogs, make the coffee and load the dishwasher are each mindfulness moments in themselves:  great teachers! <br /><br /><br /><br />I spent a good deal of last night studying a wonderful book on Buddhist yoga entitled, "Mindfulness Yoga, the Awakened Union of Breath, Body, and Mind"  by Frank Jude Boccio.  This is a serious book which relies heavily on the sutras to make its case for yoga as a contemplative practice.  I was fascinated by Boccio's depth of presentation using sources from teachings regarding the Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Noble Path, the Heart Sutra, the Sutra on the Full Awareness of Breathing, the Tao Te Ching, Thich Nhat Hahn, Shunryu Suzuki, his present teacher, Samu Sunim,  and many, many others. While I practice yoga daily, even as a contemplative aspect of my morning practice, I never quite related it to Buddhism in general or Zen.in particular.   <br /><br /><br /><br />The other text I was absorbed in, as the temperatures in the living room dropped, was Deepak Chopra's new release, "Reinventing the Body, Resurrecting the Soul".  Much like some of Chopra's earlier work, this book focuses its light on the notion that we have extraordinary powers to make our bodies better, healthier and more in-tune with the cosmos.  He divides the work into two major sections, one focused on body, the other on soul, and presents what he refers to as major "Breakthroughs"  in thinking and practice.  He draws on multiple sources from Christianity to Buddhism to the Hindu scriptures, reflecting these in the light of science as he understands it. Throughout, but not overly intrusive, are exercises the reader can do which render small diagnostic statements.  The message: we have the ability to transform ourselves.<br /><br /><br /><br />While I reserve judgement on the Chopra text, I do find books like his stimulating in terms of re-directing my own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in a way that can only be described as positive. There is a basic existential quality to the notion of taking personal responsibility to awaken ourselves, take care of our body/mind/heart, and so on.  Yet, the danger is in believing that this work is so powerful that it can replace normative medicine on the one hand, and that if we do get sick, it is somehow our fault for not doing the "right" things or not having a "healthy" attitude, on the other hand. <br /><br /><br /><br />This is where the Zen comes in, I think.  We take each step, mindful of the step and all that is in each moment.  We assume our responsibilities with due diligence.  Yet we do not define ourselves through them.  Terms like healthy, unhealthy, right, wrong, good, bad, are descriptors of values.  We use them, but should not hold onto them.<br /><br /><br /><br />Life offers us itself.  Like it or not, we are one with it.  If we oppose life, we will ultimately fail and be miserable in the process.  If we reside in life, no problem.  Everything becomes our clay with which to create ourselves. We might make strong cups from this clay or weak ones.  If the cup is broken we can mend it.  It is a tradition in Tea Service that the oldest, most broken and repaired cups are the most highly valued.  Let us each become treasured tea cups.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
