With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /> <br />In the morning my heart feels the most grounded.  I sit, pay attention to my breath, listen to the sounds of my environment, and typically take care of the kitchen, animals, and getting the coffee made.  This morning My Little Honey did these as I slept.  Apparently, I needed some extra sleep.  <br /> <br />Paying attention and opening to what is there are good practice buddies.  Resisting engaging an inner voice that wants to interrupt others, inject itself into something, or direct things, is a good third buddy.  <br /> <br />Practicing these can be a challenge on two fronts, however.  First they are challenges to our own habit energy.  Second, they are challenges for those around us.  When we attempt to make a change, that change is often met with confusion or resistance by others.  <br /> <br />This morning, just now, I was asked to help Judy with a task right in the middle of my writing.  I felt irritation.  I took a couple of breaths and attempted to do what she asked.  Her computer was hanging up, not completing the tasks I was asking it to do.  Added frustration and irritation.  My mind wandered over to what she had done to her computer to create this situation.  Big mistake. Computers are famous for allowing ghosts to get in them and mess things up.  Another breath, a smile.  While I was working n her machine, son Jason got out her other computer and got the job done... all before I could even shut down the first machine.  All the while I am simmering over being asked to step away from my morning routine. Attention to breath, release, smile.  Judy wonders what is going on.<br /> <br />Shifting gears, changing course, altering expectations, all of these are challenging for me.  I have little problem doing it when the desire to change comes from within me, but serious problems when the request for change comes from outside of me.   With practice, these are becoming much less so, yet still, there they are.  <br /><br />After Judy and Jason left to get our new car tagged, I set this writing aside. I did a scan of Judy's computer, made some breakfast and pulled out the vacuum, the furniture polish, and the Windex.  Housecleaning was my name. Afterwords, I felt refreshed and ready to come back to you. <br /> <br />Today looks exciting.  Plans are for Judy's writer's group meeting at our house at 10:00,  streetZen at 10:30,  Zen at 3:00,  Study Group at 4:00.  A full day of practice.  I invite anyone who has an interest to join us at streetZen, Zen, and/or Study Group!<br /><br />Be well.
