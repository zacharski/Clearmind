With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /> <br />There are six paramitas in Zen. These are perfections or excellence's.  Some might call them values.  The paramitas are six manifestations of the facets of our essential face.  They are the "what" of us, rather than the "who". <br /> <br />If I ask myself who was I before my father and mother were born, before my father's father, my mother's mother, what would I say?   If I said, "Ridiculous, there was no me before I was born!",  I could say, "That's skirting the question!  I am only approaching the clothing, not the body."  <br /> <br />Under the clothes, who is there?  Honestly, I must answer with some reference to core elements, eh?  Father is there, mother is there.   Teachers, friends, neighbors, lovers, wife, children, all are there.  The me of me does not exist in a vacuum, the me of me has been, and always will be conditioned, that is, subject to cause and effect and has thus been in existence in some shape or form for infinity. The who of me is always dependent.<br /> <br />So, any word would be incorrect.  A word would lead me away from my essential self and into endless philosophical quicksand.  We would be entertained, but we would not be any wiser.    <br /> <br />If, on the other hand, I asked "What was I before my father and mother were born?"  Now this question focuses our attention on something else again.  What am I?  What is my essential nature?  How do I know it?  Again, saying any word would be a mistake,  I would have to show me myself.<br /> <br />The what of me is purposeful.  It is for the sake of, rather than because of (a different, but useful tack on causation). So, too, my essential self  The paramitas are expressions of purpose, the purpose of our essential nature, a universal and infinite nature.<br /> <br />Generosity, morality, patience, diligence, meditation, and wisdom are the essential, core and universal aspects of our being. They are not values, they are manifestations. They are the what of us.  They are also the purpose of our existence.<br /><br />Our practice is to uncover and release them.<br /><br />Be well.
