With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />In the Diamond Sutra we find a single description of the Way.  It is a model for understanding the paramitas.  This description comprises the first chapter and simply reflects the Buddha's day.  <br /><br />What does a buddha do?  Before noon he puts on his patched robe, picks up his bowl and walks to town.  He takes his time, waits patiently in front of a few homes collecting food offerings.He eats, then returns to the grove, takes off his robe, puts his bowl away, washes his feet, and sits down on his cushion.  He then turns his "awareness to what is before him."  <br /><br />In this brief description is everything.  Buddha demonstrates generosity by making himself available to teach through a variety of means, including asking for help.  He demonstrates patience through his quiet standing in front of homes begging.  He teaches vigor through walking, washing, and ordering his life after eating.  Sitting down on his cushion he practices meditation, And by doing these five without getting caught in them, he demonstrates wisdom.  <br /><br />It is a simple, but challenging life.  Simple is not easy. Simple means direct and clear, unencumbered by convolutions of thought and feeling.  A buddha's life is one step in front of another, doing what is there to do without jumping up and down in the process.<br /><br /><br />Does this mean we cannot reflect joy, anger, sadness, or frustration?  No.  When these arise, they arise and we embrace them for what they are, fleeting feelings reflecting our innermost thoughts. We feel joy, we express joy; we feel frustration, we express frustration.  Yet, we do so in ways that are beneficial.  Expressing like a cannon is not helpful.  Creating hurt and sadness in others is not helpful. We recognize this and work to bring ourselves back to our breath and calm abiding.  What is there before us in such circumstances are opportunities to examine ourselves and strengthen and improve our relationships.<br /><br /><br /><br />The Buddha taught through his simple day, that we should abide in our day as it is.  Yet, we engage it with discipline and an eye toward being of benefit to all beings. Let us be that benefit.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
