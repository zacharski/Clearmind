With palms together,<br /><br />Good Afternoon All,<br /><br /><br /><br />We are now in Las Cruces unpacking and decompressing from the journey down from the Refuge. I practiced zazen facing the wooden wall. It is clear much work needs to be done there.  So, I will be returning shortly.  <br /><br /><br /><br />In any event, It was good to get to the mountains and enjoy some time with family, especially Granddaughter Sammi, who loves the place. <br /><br /><br /><br />I will post more later.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
