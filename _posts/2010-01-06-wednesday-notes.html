With palms together,<br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />The day today is full.  Breakfast Discussion Group, Torah class, lunch with friends, meeting with my Teacher Hogaku-roshi, meditation, yoga, and finally Journey's Class. Somewhere in there I need to do a walk. <br /><br /><br /><br />Such days remind me of my working life when every 30 minutes from 5:00 AM to 10:00 PM were accounted for in a huge professional office calendar.Need time to just look at the sky?  Better block it in!  <br /><br /><br /><br />Sometimes this is a very good thing.  If we are not so very well disciplined, a calendar is a wonderful tool.  We should not, however, obsess over it!  People are often surprised by how much time is actually spent in mindlessness. No time to practice zazen?  BS!  Got time to pee?  Of course.  Well?  <br /><br /><br /><br />Discipline has gotten such a bad rep.  It is far too often placed in opposition to freedom and creativity.  Big mistake. Its like responsibility.  No responsibility, no freedom.  No morning, no evening.  As sleep walkers we can get away with this. But as bodhisattvas, it is impossible.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Discipline offers s a form within which we are free.  Freedom within form is delicious.  Freedom without form is chaos.  Just keep in mind, both form and emptiness are one in the same.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well<br /><br /><br /><br />PS., I found a time to walk.
