With palms together,<br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />Cloudy skies greet the morning light.  A threat of snow lingers. The land feels barren.  Winter is like that, a natural break from the forces of growth.  Rest is important to us all.<br /><br /><br /><br />Last night I went to bed fairly early, fell asleep munching on some creamy chocolate, and woke this morning at 3:30 as Tripper wiggled  and snorted, and snuggled, until I let him and his two brothers out. Too early to rise, back to bed for another hour or so.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Rest is, indeed, important.<br /><br /><br /><br />Calm abiding in everyday life is rest in motion.  Resisting nothing, enfolding everything, living things bend and yield.  We practice to create a mind that is aware of the changing environment, as well as its own changing nature.  Anger and frustration happen: yield to patience and compassion.  Poverty and greed happen; yield to generosity and understanding.  Alienated and isolated; yield to the deep wisdom of interdependence. <br /><br /><br /><br />With each breath, a universe rises and falls.  Keep nothing.  Release everything. Our lives are ours to be lived. <br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
