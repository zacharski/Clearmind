With palms together,<br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />Lee Love, a friend in Japan, made a comment on my Face Book wall about a practice used by Tibetan  followers of the Buddha Way.  This practice, called "Tummo" is about deep concentration, a concentration that allows for the raising of body temperatures, reducing heartrate, blood pressure, metabolism, etc.   The Dalai Lama was instrumental, and continues to be, in bringing Buddha's practices under the light of scientific investigation.   <br /><br /><br /><br />Much has been learned as a result.  The text I am now reading (Buddha's Brain) is a practical guide that bases its work on such investigations.  And while there is clearly much benefit from such practices and their study, I often wonder about what we take away from such efforts.<br /><br /><br /><br />For one, I think many people see our practices as (maybe) sophisticated techniques and tools.  The practice is eviscerated, gutted of its spiritual heart. Secondly, I think people think there is something special about the practices, Tibetans, or the East.  Not so.<br /><br /><br /><br />The entire aim of practice is to simply be awake and aware. As a consequence, heart awakens, body awakens, and our senses explore without grasping.  It is nothing special.  It is allowing the world to be as it is: in our hearts, minds, and bodies.  Such practice leads to a complete awareness of the vast interconnectivity of everything.  This is prayer in each moment.  This makes every speck of sand, every bag of trash, every piece of toast or every sound, smell, taste, or touch, prayer. This is the heart of religion.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
