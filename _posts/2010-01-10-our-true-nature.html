With palms together,<br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />There are ten grave precepts, a sort of Buddhist Ten Commandments save the command part.  We often discuss these as practice guides, principles, anything but rules.  In fact they are our True Nature and reflect our compassion. <br /><br /><br /><br />The grave part is twofold: first, to violate a precept is to violate oneself, hence the universe. Second, in some places and times, to violate one of these precepts got a monk out of a sangha. <br /><br /><br /><br />As we unfold in our practice, our attention regarding precepts shifts from care for the morality of self to the nurturance of the universe. This leads in two directions it seems to me.  First it asks us to examine how our conduct nurtures others.  Second, and most importantly, is not to harm in the process.  Ahimsa:  do no harm.<br /><br /><br /><br />It is not enough to nurture, we must also protect. I wonder if these are the same or different. Awareness is key.  Can nurturance, for example, be harmful?  Co-dependence suggests it is possible when one is acting for another to the point of harming oneself. <br /><br /><br /><br />It is time for my bell to ring.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
