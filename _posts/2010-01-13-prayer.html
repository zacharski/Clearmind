With palms together,<br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />The highest way to understand prayer is as union.<br /><br /><br />Reb Nachman says,  "When a man goes out to the meadows to pray, every blade of grass, every plant and flower all enter his prayers and help him, putting power and strength into his words."  <br /><br /><br /><br />We should consider this. Sitting zazen out of doors is a very natural experience.  We drop away the bells and whistles of the Zendo and open ourselves to Everything.  Everything enters, embracing and supporting us.  In turn we are embracing and supporting Everything.  Somewhere, sometime, Everything is. It is at this point that prayer takes its power. <br /><br /><br /><br />We realize we are not praying to anything for anything, we are integrating our hearts and minds with Everything for Everything.  <br /><br /><br /><br />May we each be blessings in the Universe.
