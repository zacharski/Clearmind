With palms together,<br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Do not pursue the past.<br />Do not lose yourself in the future.<br />The past no longer is.<br />The future has not yet come.<br />Looking deeply at life as it is<br />in the very here and now,<br />the practitioner dwells<br />in stability and freedom.<br /><br /><br /><br />Buddha<br /><br /><br /><br />As so many have said, the past is past. We cannot change it.  We have done what we have done, responded as we responded, and are in this moment with its karmic results.  Just so, the future has yet to happen and it amounts to a fantasy. Reside there and Walt Disney would marry you.<br /><br /><br /><br />We abide in life as it is.  Oh boy.  Another pitch for 'the present moment'!  Yet, what is life as it is?  <br /><br /><br /><br />For me it is creating this message as I wait for My Little Honey to get herself ready to fly to Memphis.  Noticing the clock, noticing my mind.  Taking a breath and releasing into it.<br /><br /><br /><br />We do not displace the present for something other than what it is.  If anxiety is there, it is there.  If love is there, it is there.  We are present with all the things and processes that brought us to this moment and allow ourselves to see the moments unfold, opening one to the next.  <br /><br /><br /><br />I am here, what can I do?<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
