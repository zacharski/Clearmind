With palms together<br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />There are times when, like a tidal wave striking a shoreline of thatched huts, we are completely undone by an emotion. Such emotions are the great caps of the wave. We become so saturated that all things take on their feel.<br /><br /><br /><br />It is catastrophic to a human being, as it separates us from others.  The very essence of human being is social.<br /><br /><br /><br />I have a dear friend who has been overwhelmed by anger.  The hurt which caused it was like an earthquake.  Everything he had worked all of his life for was rejected, the ground he walked on sank, and he found himself in a great darkness.<br /><br /><br /><br />Responding to his pain with anger, he fanned its flames, colored nearly every event with its brush, and with each stroke, worried his friends.<br /><br /><br /><br />In such catastrophic states, everything is made far too simple.  Threat, no threat.  Friend, foe.  Its as if we are on a combat mission deep in a jungle all alone.  Every sound is suspect.<br /><br /><br /><br />As he suffers, I suffer.  My love for my friend is deep and built through real life struggles.  I sit in my Zendo and listen to my heart.  I offer incense. I practice for him. This allows me to be open to his suffering, rather than to close it off in order to protect myself. The heart of our practice is in such a willingness.<br /><br /><br /><br />Step out into the light.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
