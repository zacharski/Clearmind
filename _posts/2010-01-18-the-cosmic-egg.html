With palms together,<br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />There are living opportunities hidden in each moment regardless of time or space. The ground of our lives is fertile. When we reach out, risk, invite, embrace, or express, we transform seed into seedling.  Life unfolds through us and our creative spirit moves across its face.  The Infinite is in Everything. Allow awe to enfold you, then speak its name.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
