With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /> <br />The morning brings desert wind and small splatters of rain.  I imagine the desert floor is being swept by the Infinite.  I remember once while climbing the Organ Mountains, a storm came out of the southwest.  From my elevation, I could see it rolling across the valley toward the mountains.  The feeling was a sweet combination of fear and utter awe.<br /> <br />Such moments enter one's body like a shotgun to the stomach. <br /> <br />Over time, this feeling lays in wait.  It can open and spread, like a pool of honey being fed by that Infinite Wellspring or it can remain a puddle being stepped over by those of us who are busy.<br /><br />This morning as I walked outside, my feet refused to move. My eyes were fixed on clouds rolling down the slopes of the Organs. I was transfixed.  <br /><br />Whatever the Infinite is, it is here.<br /><br />Be well.
