With palms together,<br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />Senzaki-roshi says, "The old timers in a religious group consider themselves to have reached the top, and then jump from where they are, leaving the very principles of that religion.  They are poor fish who cannot swim in the water."<br /><br /><br /><br />When our eyes are open, there is no question, we swim because it is what we do.  An open eye is a completely integrated eye, therefore eye and no eye at once.<br /><br /><br /><br />When about to face a question, we cannot answer.  We answer only when the question is asked and we do so without pointing.  <br /><br /><br /><br />As Leonard Cohen says, dance me till the end of love.<br /><br /><br /><br />And if love is the essential, core, complete and total reality?<br /><br /><br /><br />Dance on...<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
