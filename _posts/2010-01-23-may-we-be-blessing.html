With palms together,<br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />Morning of the only day there is<br /><br />opens in silence. <br /><br />My breath is slow and steady.  <br /><br />My heart opens to you.  <br /><br />Breathing in, I take in our suffering, <br /><br />breathing out, I offer us my love. <br /><br /> <br /><br />But there is so very much suffering <br /><br />and yet I am serene.<br /><br /><br /><br />Last night <br /><br />at a Rabbi's house<br /><br />We said a blessing, <br /><br />ate a lovely meal, <br /><br />and settled in to watch. <br /><br />a film <br /><br />.<br /><br />It was about an IED unit in Iraq.  <br /><br />And demanded recall:<br /><br /><br /><br />war is far more than a nasty word...<br /><br /><br /><br />The energy of deep compassion <br /><br />Set a-swirl, like the stars in the sky<br /><br />in a drunken night...i chant,<br /><br />Everything is precious.<br /><br /><br />All my past and harmful karma...<br /><br />Born from beginningless greed, hate, and delusion,<br /><br />Through body, speech, and mind,<br /><br />I now fully avow...<br /><br /><br /><br />Scotch helps. <br /><br />As does zazen. <br /><br />Breathing in, <br /><br />breathing out.<br /><br /><br /><br />It is morning.  <br /><br />and I have not slept much. <br /><br />I sit in the zendo and listen. <br /><br /><br /><br />The sky is still dark<br /><br />But the swirls have<br /><br />become gentle streams. <br /><br />Vast wings <br /><br />enfold all beings <br /><br />and I release myself <br /><br />into them.<br /><br /><br /><br />Let war be no more, let love be your light.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
