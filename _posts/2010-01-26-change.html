With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Our lives are full of mysteries and we organize them into what makes sense and what does not, what we accept and what we do not, what we fear, love, hate, and just plain will not admit to. Its all very natural.  Its all very challenging. So, we pretend or hope or pray. And one day it all comes crashing down.  The paradigm no longer tolerates the cracks.<br /><br />The world took a long time to accept the planet was not flat...some still believe it to be so.  The new paradigm takes time to settle in, to gain acceptance, and for us to throw off the old. <br /><br />We have a view of things, perhaps from childhood, perhaps from an experience so penetrating that its memory always remains fresh, or perhaps from a social convention: what to do when this view no longer works?<br /><br />As John Bingham is fond of saying regarding running, "There's No Need for Speed". Patience is a necessary partner in this process, as are all the other paramitas.  A wise person does not rush in to change the world.  Nor does he tarry along the way.   Nor does he throw the baby out with the bathwater. We rarely know what the change needs to be, what direction it should take, or how far it should go.<br /><br />Life offers us many opportunities to address change, as change is like the elephant in the room no one seems willing to seriously address. Religious views change, social practices and norms change, our essential understanding of ourselves changes. all the while we hold on, put off, deny, or otherwise fail to deal.<br /><br />An open heart, an open mind, and a compassionate hand go a long way in this process Change is difficult, not changing in the face of a need for change can be tragic.<br /><br />We waddle on.<br /><br />Be well
