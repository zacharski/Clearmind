With palms together,<br /><br />Good Morning All,<br /><br /><br /><br />Being lost.  Feeling as if there is nothing familiar --- or that the familiar is slipping away and cannot be grasped ---, this is in the pit of our stomach yuk.    We avoid such places.  We want desperately for solid ground.  Its only natural.  <br /><br /><br /><br />However, all is not lost, ever.  We are.  We are not individuals. New does not happen without a dropping away of old.  And creation is always on-going.  Far from nihilism, Zen resides in eternal change.<br /><br /><br /><br />Any effort to open our eyes when lost will reveal new wonders.  Lost just means we feel the loss of our cradle.  Step out.  Stand up. Be alive.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
