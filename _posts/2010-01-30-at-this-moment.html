With palms together,<br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />At this moment, <br /><br />I woke from a dream <br /><br />and can no longer see <br /><br />heaven.  <br /><br />The ladder has lifted. <br /><br />Or maybe was never there.  <br /><br />(We can never be sure.)  <br /><br />The voice is silent:<br /><br />I am left to sit alone <br /><br />In its echo.<br /><br />This is the ground <br /><br />of being itself <br /><br />and I sit upon it <br /><br />with no fear.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
