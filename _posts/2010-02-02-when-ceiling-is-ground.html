With palms together,<br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />If we lay down on the floor and look up, we get an entirely different view of our environment. Furnishing seem larger, their undersides are exposed, the ceiling seems like the floor with lights sprouting up from it.  We are resting in the sky.<br /><br /><br /><br />I do this often, lay on the floor, and it is both refreshing as a reminder of the power of perspective, and as a healing for my body.<br /><br /><br /><br />Take an opportunity and lay down on the floor, better if outside, perceive the sky, the ceiling, the underside of things.  Experience the Earth supporting you.  Be thankful.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
