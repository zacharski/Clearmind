With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br />The morning air is cold and the sky is dark. I put on the fire in the fireplace, made some coffee, and spent a little time picking up books.  Somehow, my library spread through the living room and dining area, across the counter, and over my desk. Odd papers, folders, and a few pens completed the mess.  This is the inevitable result of writing.  We want our sources right in front of us.  So, too, practice.<br /><br />Our primary source in practice is ourselves.  We sit facing a wall. Nothing else is there. This form isolates us and because this is so, it offers an opportunity to experience without secondary sources, i.e., the constant flow of voices and images around us. <br /><br />This practice is a source of life and vitality.  As things clear away, our life reveals itself as directly as possible. Like being able to see the granite counter under the books, we can see what is there rather than what we think is there.<br /><br />When I take away the clutter clarity returns and with it our life energy rises.<br /><br />Be well
