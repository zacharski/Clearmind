With palms together,<br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /> <br /><br />Today is one of those days, oy, one of those days, where cards and candy, flowers, and schmaltz flow like tidal waves, and at the speed of light, yet. <br /><br /> <br /><br />I will freely admit, I am not fond of Valentine's Day.  I feel it is so artificial, so contrived,and  worse, shallow.<br /><br /> <br /><br />People spend so much time and money on cards, candy, and other ready-mades, and so little time and energy on the real thing. <br /><br /> <br /><br />Love is hard.  It is work.  Love requires things of us we are so often unwilling to give.  A piece of paper with a sentiment?  Please.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Couples grow, relationships change.  Sometimes they deepen, sometimes they remain stuck in romantic notions of by-gone times. Love requires a willingness to risk living in new growth. It requires a recasting of ideas, thoughts, and behaviors. <br /><br /> <br /><br />We love our partners and are committed to them.  But this love is dynamic and changes over time. and because this is so, the nature of the relationship must change. Often deeper, sometimes in different directions, we work to hold on to an ever-changing ground.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The test of a relationship and the people in it is their willingness to release themselves from the bondage of history and step into a deeper, more satisfying present. Love is not two dimensional, it is incredibly multidimensional with surfaces facing in all directions.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Today I vow to open my heart to all those dimensions and directions..<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well,
