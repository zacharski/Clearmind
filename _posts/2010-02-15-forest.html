With palms together,<br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />Last night I was working on a paper concluding a course of study in Judaism and I found myself just writing as I do in my blogs.  It is a mistake I think to try to consider a religious point of view as one thing or another.  <br /><br /><br />The practice is to just be.<br /><br /><br /><br />So, in the middle of writing, I composed this:<br /><br /><br /><br />The Infinite does not speak to me, <br />It whispers, kisses, and hovers.  <br />It rises thrugh my fingers <br />with each touch of a key <br />on my keyboard <br />like fingers touching a mirror. <br />there It is,..<br />Tactile dialogue<br />as words pirouette.<br /><br /><br />I think I like being lost in the wilderness of a forest where nothing has a name and everything is just there before me. It makes every touch count.<br /><br />Be well.
