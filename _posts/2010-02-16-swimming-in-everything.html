With palms together,<br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />This morning I will drive over to Temple Beth El and do what I am calling Contemplative Practices there.  Beginning Monday I will do this daily on weekdays at 7:00 AM.  Contemplative Practices are Morning Prayers, Meditation, and Yoga.  Each to be done mindfully, slowly, and with the aim of developing gratitude, compassion, and patience for the day.<br /><br /><br /><br />For me, Zen practice is a universal componant to all contemplative practices.  Zen in stillness (seated practice), and Zen in motion (eating, walking, yoga, weghts, tai chi, work, etc.), are all one in the same thing:  mindful living<br /><br /><br /><br />When we live mindfully: we are living with an open heart, open to the Infinite.  Whether we call this the Infinite, Big Mind, Buddha Nature, Christ, God, a Highr Power, or simply the Highest Good, is irrelevant.  In fact, what we call it can be problematic if the term we use denotes a static conception or image because of our natural inclination to grasp such a thin and hold onto it.<br /><br /><br /><br />So, it is a challenge to live without nouns!  Life as continuous, never-ending process, has nothing stable upon which to stand.  This lack of firm foundation is very scary. Yet, like being underwater in a pool, our environment completely surrounds us and as we relax into it we join it. Pure freedom, yes, but most importantly, we are in a position to taste life as it is, rather than as we think it is.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
