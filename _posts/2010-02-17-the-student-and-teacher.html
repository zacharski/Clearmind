With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone, <br />The night sky invites my eye.  I am sitting at my dining room table next to the picture window. When I turn off the lights, it is as though I am sitting in a planetarium. There is such beauty in the early morning.  The sound of the heating system, or the boys padding around on the tile floor, or the crunch of somebody nibbling at the dog food I just put down:  these are the sounds moving through the darkness.  <br />It is good to have this time.  I face a very busy day today, as Wednesdays typically are for me.  Gentle time to be aware, unhurried, and unfolding is precious. Such moments are true teachers.<br />The lessons involve the mysteries of our personal connection to that which is hidden.  How we face these mysteries is important. With open or closed eyes?  With open or closed ears?  With open or closed heart?<br />Be still and pay attention I whisper to myself. <br />Be well,
