With palms together,<br /><br />Good Evening Everyone, <br /><br />This day was a long one.  I just returned from El Paso where I sat with the No Sides/Both Sides Zen Sangha, a border community.  Two Zensters were from Juarez one of whom, Susanna, used to come to Zen Center to sit with me. It was very good to see her again.<br /><br />I will be ordaining Bobby Byrd, one of the founders of that Zendo, the first week or April at Hanamatsuri Bobby and I go back a few years now and it is good to see him take this step.  <br /><br />Afterwards, we had dinner, Bobby, John Fortunato, and me.  It was good to meet with these two Zensters.  Three old farts sitting in a Middle Eastern Caf√© in El Paso Texas talking Zen, Christianity, and Judaism: who da thunk it?<br /><br />The seeds are being planted. May the flowers bloom.<br /><br />Be well.<br /><br />A reminderr:  there are no Sunday Zen Services at my personal Zendo until further notice.
