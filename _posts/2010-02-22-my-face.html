With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br />Stepping out of the light of the known, approaching the edge, what is my face? The edge between the known and the unknown is the true heart of darkness, At this edge I experience what at first feels like fear, but when I open my eyes! Awe. <br />In this place, I realize there is no true darkness because darkness is only a doorway to the light of my True Nature.  What is my face? <br /><br />Be well
