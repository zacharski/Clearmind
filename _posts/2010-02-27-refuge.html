With palms together,<br /><br />Good Evening Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />The Refuge seemed cold and barren without students. There is much work that needs to be done there, gutter replacement, solar system upgrade, generator repair, general grounds clean-up.  Winter exposes so much!<br /><br /><br /><br />Ken-roshi  replaced our water pump, but the hoses to the storage tanks had been damaged by snow and ice, so pumping was out of the question. It seems Dharma Mountain was damaged as well: two breaks in foof beams.  This winter has brought lots of snow and precious few days of higher temperatures to melt the stuff.  <br /><br /><br /><br />As spring approaches and depending on finances, I will try to begin repairs with the help of sons Jacob and Jason, as well as any others who might be interested.  Gutter replacement is top priority as we will need to collect the water we need for the year through the coming rainy season.<br /><br /><br /><br />Due my change in status and the costs of repairs, I am forced to ask for donations.I will be sitting streetZen more often as the days pass with begging bowl.  Clear Mind Zen has a donation button on our website, www.clearmindzen.org<br /><br /><br /><br />If you are able and so desire, please consider helping.<br /><br /><br /><br />Thank you.
