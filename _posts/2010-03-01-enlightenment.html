With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br />There is a koan about a man who complains upon seeing a picture of a bearded Bodhidharma:  “Why hasn’t that fellow a beard?”<br /><br />Mumon comments, “If you want to study Zen, you must study it with your heart.”<br /><br />When we see what we want to see, we are not seeing at all.  If we convince ourselves we are awake, even if we have had a glimpse, we are a universe away from the clear eye. As in climbing a mountain, we should climb without climbing; in sitting, we should sit without sitting. <br /><br />This is our way.<br /><br />The other day I went to a mountain and believed I had climbed it.  Silly me.  <br /><br />Be well.
