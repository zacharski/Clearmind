With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br />Sitting this morning in my personal Zendo, the incense calls me to stillness.  I have just performed Teihatsu No Ge, shaving my head to free myself from attachments. I do this every three days. It is an important ritual in the Zen lexicon.  <br />Some people close to me believe I am making myself ugly. Perhaps.  However, I see a buddha opening in the mirror before me. The reflection is a personal reminder of who I am and why I am here. Teihatsu No Ge  is an action of divestment of personal interest.<br />A Zen Buddhist priest (or lay member) in the Order of Clear Mind Zen teaches through example. We live a life of study, contemplation, social action, and work.  We also live in relationships with others, as we are a lay order, not a monastic order.<br />This Order is open to anyone willing to dedicate themselves to the Three Pure Precepts:<br />1. Cease Doing Evil<br />2. Do Good<br />3. Bring About Abundant Good for All Beings<br />We are not affiliated with Soto Shu in Japan.  We are our own authority established through  my Master, Rev. Hogaku McGuire-roshi and his Master, Rev. Dr. Soyu Matsuoka-roshi.<br />May we each be a blessing in the Universe.<br /><br />Be well.
