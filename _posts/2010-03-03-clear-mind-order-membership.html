With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br />The Order of Clear Mind Zen is a socially engage lay Order.  We are not monastics, but rather, everyday practitioners of Zen.  The Order was established by Harvey Daiho Hilbert-roshi in 2005.  It has no building, it exists through the actual practice of its members.  It is a street-bound Order. <br /><br />Anyone can be a member of the Order.  Members do not have to be priests.  Members must honor the following six vows:<br /><br />1. I take Refuge in Everything That Is (Buddha)<br />2. I take Refuge in Reality and its Teachings (Dharma)<br />3. I take Refuge in the Order (Sangha)<br />4. I vow to cease creating evil<br />5. I vow to do good<br />6. I vow to work to create abundant good for all beings,<br /><br />Persons who wish to become members of the Order must telephone Daiho-roshi for a set of brief interviews designed to explore the Order’s precepts and gain Roshi’s approval for membership.  Once granted, the petitioner will recite our vows with Roshi.<br />Each member will have sewn a strip of black cloth into a 2” x 36” strip tacked together to form a loop.  This is called a wagessa and is considered a modern version of a Zen robe. Members who wish may order wagessas from us.  These will come with our embroidered emblems on each side. (The cost is $15.00 plus shipping)<br /><br />Membership will include a printed certificate stamped by Daiho roshi. This carries a commitment to live as Zen Buddhists following Clear Mind precepts.<br /><br />A suggested donation of $24.00 per year is asked for.  At $2.00 per month it helps us create printed materials, offer incense, and candles, as well as provide a small degree of comfort to those in need.<br /><br />If you are interested please reply to Roshi via his personal email.  harveyhilbert@yahoo.com
