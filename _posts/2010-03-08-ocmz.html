With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br />This morning I would like to talk about the Order of Clear Mind Zen. Traditionally “Orders” are understood to be lineages within sects that hold certain precepts and a common mission. The Order of Clear Mind Zen (OCMZ or, the Order) is no different. In our case, the Order is open to anyone who has taken the Buddhist precepts and who has an interest in, and commitment to, engaged Zen practice.<br /><br />I have envisioned the Order to be homeless, that is to say, without a headquarters, building, and other baggage. In a sense, it is a child of the Internet, a virtual community, with a real world presence in the hearts of each of its members. <br /><br />One need not shave one’s head, vow celibacy, or wear robes.  Of course, these are permissible, and as to head shaving and robes, encouraged.  Yet, we are contemporary Zen Practitioners with modern and post-modern minds. <br /><br />Our mission is to bring “good” into the world through our practice.  We define “good” as that which sustains and nurtures life, work for peace, and teach non-violent solutions to everyday issues.<br /><br />Rev. KoMyo, my disciple and able adjunct, will accept your applications to join our order.  The process is simply, simply ask and offer either your willingness to take the precepts or evidence that you have already done so, along with a statement about your current practice. We will then get in contact with you to complete the process of affirming your membership in the Order.<br /><br />A bow to each of you,
