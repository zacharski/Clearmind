With palms together,<br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />Life is good: even on sleepless nights it's whisper is a refreshing kiss of the Infinite.I sleep on the floor next to my altar in a sleeping bag.  Next to me is my connection to you. <br /><br /><br /><br />Overnight I had a conversation with my senior disciple, Rev. Bussho.  I wrote to my friend. Anshin who I will be visiting on retreat next month. In each case my fingers were guided by my love for them. <br /><br /><br /><br />Such a gift, friends.  Through each other we make our lives eternal.<br /><br /><br /><br />The Sandokai says,<br /><br /><br /><br />"Each of the myriad things has its merit, <br /><br />expressed according to its function and place.<br /><br />Existing phenomonally like a box and cover joining;<br /><br />according with principle like an arrow points to meeting."<br /><br /><br />According to friend Greg, the First Commandment is, "You shall survive." One cradles the other in infinite direction and embrace.<br /><br /><br /><br />Forward and backward are a delusion which when extinguished offers us the present.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
