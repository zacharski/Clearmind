With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br />Sitting in a Starbucks, I am joining America. Bold coffee, cheese Danish, and notebook at the ready!  My AT & T account is closed!  iPhone tragedy, I guessed.  Small wave of “Not Able to Connect” panic arises. <br /><br />I sit with this.  Take a breath, sip my coffee, and explore the options available:  no credit cards, little cash, and a willingness to engage.  All systems are a go.  I realize I have Qwest service at home.  Aha!  So I call them, conference with my estranged partner to get secret data, and soon a “Mike” comes on the line giving me my precious three digit access code!  <br /><br />Zip, zip, as one handed fingers type, and here I am, back with you.<br /><br />Yesterday I spoke with my friend Claude Anshin.  His voice was reassuring.  We are brothers.  It is good to have a strong shoulder to rest on and a willingness to do so. Our practice is to awaken to the empty reality of an “I” and realize the vast, though equally empty, interdependence of “us.” How can we survive if we are not open?<br /><br />Our lives depend on it.<br /><br />Be well.
