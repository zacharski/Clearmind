With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br />There are Four Noble Truths in Buddha’s Teaching.  Simply put, these are: suffering is; it is caused by investing one’s self in something that lacks any permanence; it can be stopped; and we stop it by waking up.  There are eight aspects to an awakened heart/mind.  Buddha called these the Eightfold Noble Path. Path is important as it points to process, a walk along the way. Yet as we might eventually (and rightly) come to, one is always a diamond just waiting to undress and expose one’s facets. Therefore, the process is not the thing, but rather the undressing of the thing. Mindful Practice is our process. <br /><br />These eight aspects have to do with our practical lives: Awakened Understanding, Thought, Action, Speech, Livelihood, Effort, Mindfulness, and Concentration. The usual translation is “Right” or “Correct” but I see these as more a sense of true, not in the true/false way, but in the trueness of a line or a weight.  There is a quality of internal and external consonance involved. This comes from a clear mind.<br /><br />Recent events in my life have sorely tested my understanding of the clarity of my mind. What am I doing?  Why am I doing it?  Is this so?  These are my mantra-like questions.<br /><br />Here are the answers arising from my heart:  I am committing to a life as a being in fulltime service to others.  This may take on the clothing of a priest, a monk, or a simple person acting out loving-kindness.  However, these are just the clothes and we should be kind to those who confuse the two. I am doing this because I have no choice. The suffering of the world, because of war and violence rings too loudly in my ears not to respond. It is so.<br /><br />I have spent decades taking care of self, family, and being in service as a therapist.  It is time to complete the process by shifting my attention to the others as a bodhisattva.<br />I have created a separate account for the Order of Clear Mind Zen.  I will move as quickly as possible making the Order a NM State Non-Profit Corporation so that donations will be, without question, tax-deductable. I have decided to place my share of marital assets in a trust for my three children. <br /><br />Be well.
