With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br />It is a good morning this morning.  Zazen went well, and few wonderful breaths centering myself and being with the sounds of the world around me. <br /><br /><br />Yesterday several of us went to the Both Sides/No Sides Zendo in El Paso. We sat with the Sangha and I offered a teaching on Kie Sanbo, receiving the three refuges. This was followed by a ceremony bringing Soku Shin into the Order.  I am always delighted to offer such opportunities.  It was a beautiful ceremony.<br /><br /><br /><br />The thing about precepts is they are from the inside out.  We are all buddhas in disguise. We wear the masks of duality.  A Zen Teacherâ€™s job is to help the student see the face under the mask and work with a Sangha to make it possible for the student to live without it. <br /><br /><br />Living in a world of duality with greed and hatred as partners is toxic to the heart.  These three poisons make evil possible, even acceptable to some. Yet, in truth, duality is a delusion and once its mask is removed, we are free.  Generosity and compassion become our medicines and we apply them in ways unique and specific to the individual.<br /><br /><br />Sometimes what is required looks nothing like generosity or compassion, yet, when the aim is true, the arrow hits the mark, and the suffering person is relieved.  Of course, this relief is not always what the person expects or even understands as relief. No matter, the important work is being done. <br /><br /><br />Be well.
