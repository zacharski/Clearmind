With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br /><br />Yesterday I did walking meditation at Veteranâ€™s Park. I walked around the grassy field, then up the walkway to the flagpoles, around the crescent wall with names of those who served from New Mexico.  A man was standing there.  He pointed to his name. I welcomed him home and we continued walking in different directions.  <br /><br />Walking back down toward the rotunda, I saw a wonderful sight. A man had come onto the grassy field and was flying a model plane, but it had no motor.  It was radio controlled and I watched with childlike delight as he maneuvered the plane to rise and fall, eventually landing it softly at his feet. He wanted to make his plane fly higher.<br /><br />I returned to the rotunda and stood like a tree. <br /><br />Three men, three universes: one.<br /><br />When the question is common<br />The answer is also common.<br />When the question is sand in a bowl of boiled rice<br />The answer is a stick in the soft mud.<br />Case 31 Joshu Investigates, trans by Nyogen Senzaki<br />Be well.
