With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br />Overnight I was awake many hours, having dozed off earlier on the sofa. The thing about late night overnight’s is things seem to get done.  I planned my itinerary to the Omega Institute’s “Veteran’s Retreat with Claude Anshin Thomas” in April.  I found tickets for less than four hundred dollars. I did my laundry.  I “picked up” and organized my room.  I did considerable practice.<br /><br />It is morning now and time to face another day.  May all beings be free from suffering, may we each be a blessing in the universe, and may we each nurture in our hearts the willingness to forgive those who harm us.<br /><br />The incense has burned itself out, the birds are up, the flowers and the trees are up, and the day’s weather looks glorious.<br /><br />Be well.
