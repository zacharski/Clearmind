With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone, <br />The coffee is now brewing.  I have washed up, offered incense, and sat zazen. Next, will be drink the coffee, do short yoga, shave an already shaved head, and shower. In between, you.<br /><br />With whom am I speaking each morning?  I often wonder about this. A writer writes with someone in mind. This writing is no different.  I think it is a genre called creative non-fiction, though I am sure it is all fiction as it is what I create out of my perceptions, thoughts, and feelings. <br /><br />So, when I sit down to write, what is the “you” I am writing?  Is it someone specific?  Is it the Everyman?  Or is it myself?  Are these the same or different? Is it necessary to know?<br /><br />For me, I write to <i>shin</i>.  That is to say, mind/heart.  With each moment, I breathe in, closing my eyes, experiencing myself, allowing the snow in the globe to settle as I release my breath.  Clear Mind. In that clarity, there you are.<br /><br />Be well.
