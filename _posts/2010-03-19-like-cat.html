With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Consumation<br /><br />Morning arrives in the night <br />Like a cat on the prowl <br />For something to eat. <br />I turn myself <br />Open, ready to be released.<br /><br />Zen practice is the practice of eternal life. <br />Awake, I see <br />You are not you <br />And I am not I <br />And we are not we, <br />Yet at once, <br />You are you, <br />I am I, <br />And we are we. <br />Past, present and future <br />Are mere thoughts. <br />Living and dying <br />Are simply dreams.<br /><br />In such a place, <br />The only step <br />Is the step originating in the night, <br />The Self making the self.
