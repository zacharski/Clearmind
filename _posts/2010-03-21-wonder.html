With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />This morning was wonderful: silence, good sleep, and then opening my eyes to such beauty!  Our world is so full of good things: hugs, smiles, and lovingkindness. <br /><br />It is all a matter of willingness.  We must be willing to open ourselves, drop the barriers, and live fully and completely.  So challenging at first.  So everyday later. Seated on a cushion, we worry if we are doing it right, what people will think, and so on. Yet, with practice, we experience breath and existence as formless form. <br /><br />Last night Zen Student Soku Shin and I worked through the first part of Master Dogenâ€™s Bendowa. When we realize buddha, all is buddha.  All was buddha.  All will continue to be buddha. Once the True Dharma Eye is opened, everything changes but remains the same.  Spacious Mind and Narrow Mind are actualized as One and a Zenster can now be the Universe and a Zenster, as well as no Zenster and no Universe simultaneously. <br /><br />Aim for seamless being.<br /><br />Be well.
