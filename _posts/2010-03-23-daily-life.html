With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Sitting on my cushion, in front of me is a small handmade Medicine Buddha.  His right hand extends down from serenity to touch the Earth.  His left hand holds his medicine bowl. <br /><br />In our practice we must remember to touch the Earth, which is to say, be grounded.  We also must bear in mind our purpose as bodhisattvas is to heal and transform.  All with a serene and calm heart.<br /><br />At first blush, this may seem an awesome and extremely challenging task. Yet know the Earth is here to support us.  It is our foundation. And our medicine flows from our heart. When we assume to posture of zazen, we assume the posture of buddha: mind/heart/body/environment are one and every step is the correct step.<br /><br />May we walk together along the Way.<br /><br />Be well.
