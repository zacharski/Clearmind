With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br />“Transitions are always difficult,” Soku Shin said to me. Without thinking, I agreed too quickly. In retrospect, saying such a thing has certain implications.  I recognize transitions are the essential nature of our lives.  Indeed, as we come to experience, change is life. However, if this is so, are we then saying life is always difficult?  Change in any direction involves a loss of what was and an apprehension of what might be next. It also involves experiencing what is.  Depending on where our mind’s eye rests we will answer yes or no.  <br /><br />In chapter 31 of Shobogenzo (Kai-in-zanmai), Master Dogen quotes Buddha as saying, <br />“An instant before, an instant after: instant does not depend on instant; a dharma before, a dharma after: dharma does not oppose dharma.  Just this is called Samadhi, state like the sea.”<br /><br />A buddha is a buddha in every moment, not holding on, not letting go, just being buddha.  Standing on the shore we might see the sea rise and fall, being the sea itself, no rising, no falling. Both are true, neither opposes one another. Each is exactly and completely itself. <br /><br />Three A.M. is just this moment, neither early nor late. Only in relation to four A. M. might it take on before or after. To realize one Truth also realizes the Other.<br /><br />Be well.
