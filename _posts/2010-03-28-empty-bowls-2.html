With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Empty bowls are an opportunity; full bowls are an opportunity.  Being generous is an opportunity; being self-sufficient is an opportunity.  Lessons can be learned from everything in every time and condition, provided there is space for learning to take place.  We create this space through our very deliberate practice of zazen. <br /><br />Judgments about conditions do nothing to address conditions.  To fill a bowl does not diminish it and leaving it empty does not enhance it. However, practicing generosity, compassion, and love does nurture us and our world, whereas, practicing greed, heartlessness, and hate diminishes our interdependence and connectivity.<br /><br />Practice Prajna Paramita.<br /><br />Be well.
