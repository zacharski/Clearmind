With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br />The morning air is chilly again and my bones ache as I roll over in my sleeping bag bed in my empty room. I wait eagerly for summer as my body feels so much better when it is warm and sweaty.  <br /><br />There is an old koan that talks about no hot, no cold.  When we are in a centered place, the place of prajna paramita, a place of just this breath with no discernment, there is, indeed, no hot or cold.  Yet, this place also has hot and cold:  So, when hot, get cooler; when cold, get warmer.  The truth of Zen is that both are true simultaneously.  The Absolute Truth contains the Relative Truth and the Relative Truth contains the Absolute Truth.<br /><br />So what?<br /><br />When my bones ache, I take an anti-inflammatory pill.  I do so without judgment, discernment, or second-guessing. To live this way is to live at one.  At the top of the hundred-foot pole we step out in complete faith.<br /><br />Be well.
