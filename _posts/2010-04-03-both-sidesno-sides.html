With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br />Today is a wonderful day.  The sun has not risen yet, but the eastern sky is pregnant. This morning several Order members will drive to El Paso to the Both Sides No Sides Zen Sangha.  Also meeting there will be my Teacher, Hogaku-roshi, his wife, Shin Getsu-roshi, and several of my priest disciples. It is always a delight to have everyone come together, but doubly so for such an occasion as Shukke Tokudo, priest ordination. <br /> <br /><br />In ancient times, priests were required to leave home in order to enter the Way. It was believed, and so Master Dogen taught, that the duties of a householder precluded the aims of a priest. Renunciation of all worldly things, including family was understood to be necessary.<br /><br />Today, we do not necessarily hold that view in the Zen world.  Although some monastic centers such as Shasta Abbey (Order of Buddhist Contemplatives) does require celibacy and priests are not allowed to be married. <br /><br />The Order of Clear Mind Zen takes the position that householding is just as clear a dharma gate as monastic life, or the challenges of celibacy, or those of he life of a wandering Buddhist.  It is the attitude one takes toward any given moment that allows the Dharma to emerge.<br /><br />An attitude of “Don’t Know” and “Just Go Straight” as Master Seung Sahn was fond of using, is essential and possible within home life.  In fact, I would argue that home life is an incredibly powerful Zen practice arena.<br /><br />Still, there is something to be said for waiting until we have a few years under our proverbial belts.  Elders are not always so prone to so eagerly jump into change, often have the wisdom only a long view can provide, and have often mastered a degree of patience those younger students do not share. <br /><br />In the case of today’s ordination, Student Hen Shin, has waited, churned, and stewed with Zen for many years.  I have churned and stewed with him.  Hen Shin is a remarkable poet (Goggle Bobby Byrd) and a man with an incredible social conscience. Together, he and his student, John, built the Both sides/No Sides Zen community which bridges both the US and Mexican communities in the El Paso/Juarez area.  I am indeed blessed to call this man my friend.<br /><br />Be well.
