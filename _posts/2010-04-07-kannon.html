With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br />On my small altar in my bedroom, where I sit to write to you, is a Medicine Buddha, a small statue of Kannon and a set of photographs.  The pictures are of my father and grandfather on one side and my grandfather and myself on the other side. I have placed the Bodhisattva of Compassion in the vortex between them.<br /><br />My father was a wounded healer.  I first wrote warrior, but corrected it as he was a medic during world war two in the south pacific. His job was blood and guts. And forever after, he washed himself with beer and whiskey.<br /><br />My grandfather on my motherâ€™s side was a gentle soul, a farmer-gardener, who made paper for a living in New Jersey. I have fond memories of summer visits, cherry trees, flowers, and tea with cinnamon sugar toast. <br /><br />Together they gave rise to me.  I hold Kannon in my heart center forever there to accept the cries of the universe.<br /><br />Be well.
