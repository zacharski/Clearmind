With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone, <br />Yesterday’s morning Zazen was particularly still.  I had spent much of my early morning repairing a very old mokugyo that was damaged by someone using a drumstick on its surface. A mokugyo is a hollowed out wooden block made to look a bit like a fish with bulging eyes and is used to keep time in chanting. This one was scratched, pitted, and pitiful.  For several days, I have been oiling it with lemon oil, as it was so dry it was like tinder.  <br /><br />Anyway, I took out fine sandpaper and sanded and sanded and sanded.  Then I scraped out the red paint some prior owner had painted in its face and oiled some more.  Time got away from me and I suddenly realized my samue (black work clothes) were full of sanding dust. I barely got to the park on time.<br /><br />There is something about this particular mokugyo that has caught my heart.  Maybe it is that it is just so pitiful, maybe because its small, or even that I traded it with the Both Sides/No Sides Zen community for the larger mokugyo I had in my Zendo.  They had purchased the beat-up little gal off the Internet for about four dollars I understand.<br />.<br />Everything needs a home; everything needs love.  I have grown fond of this mokugyo (I am naming, Harriet) because it is just my size and reminds me of myself. I am inviting Harriet to help me bring my body, speech, and mind together each morning as we chant:  kan ji zai bo satsu gyo jin hannya hara mita ji sho ken go on kai ku do issai ku yaku…<br /><br />In the afternoon, we visited two people, one a homeless man in the hospital for pneumonia.  The other is an elder who craves company. He lives in a nursing home. With the former, we listened, with the latter we talked out under a tree and listened to birds and the flow of water from a fountain.<br /><br /><br />April 13, 2010<br />This morning, a new day, Clear Mind Zendo, in conjunction with Temple Beth El, will host 5 bicycle riders of a group of some 25 riders who are riding across America for World Health.  I have several air mattresses and will make sure everything is in good shape for them. <br />Yesterday two benefactors offered very substantial donations to the Order of Clear Mind Zen.  I am considering how best to use this money and believe a part should be used to purchase new zabutons and zafus. Purchase of student supplies should be next; things such as rakusu rings, jizu beads, and the like, since we offer these to students without charge. Yesterday we did purchase a small standing Buddha for Hannamatsuri ceremonies, as well as a wall hanging expressing a teaching of the Buddha, a small button that asks, “What would Buddha Do?” and a small “Co-Exist” window sticker The balance will be held in savings. <br /><br />We are grateful for these and other recent offerings of dana. Surely we are beneficiaries of very generous hearts,<br /><br />Be well.
