With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />This morning I am waking up to “kids” in my Zendo.  Youthful medical students from all over are riding across America on their bicycles offering talks on health related issues.  Temple Beth El is hosting them overnight on their way from San Diego to Washington, DC. Temple members divided up the group, offering our homes to them for the night. I have four and Zen Student Colette has four. Last night they enjoyed stories, some wine, and my community’s hot tub.  This morning they will climb on their bikes and ride to El Paso where they will offer a talk.<br /><br />Young doctors with great compassion: impressive. You may follow these athletes here:  <br /><br />http://www.rideforworldhealth.org/ <br /><br />May they enjoy a safe journey and continue to be a blessing in the universe.
