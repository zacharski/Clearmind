With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br />There is a place of no suffering.  It is a place where we live in complete freedom and complete responsibility, yet without fear, without pain, without loss. I touch this place on very sweet occasions. Rare, like the so sweet passing chill in the air on a hot summer’s day, it is not something that can stay with us. Unless.  Unless.<br /><br />Yesterday I felt very tired.  The day before was quite long and exhausting.  I left Torah study early, took a nap, and found that I had slept right through the first meeting of a new class I had looked forward to attending.  Dokusan with Student Dai Shugyo was followed by another rest period, then off to do meditation at Temple Beth El.<br /><br />Usually this is followed by yoga, but yesterday was different.  The Social Action Committee had scheduled a meeting right in the middle of the class.  Since I was invited to become the next chair of that committee, I attended.<br /><br />After the committee meeting, I went home to meet with my Jisha, Soku Shin.  We talked about our day and about me in relation to it.  My Jisha helps me clarify; she is like a living kyosaku. What I am coming to address in my life is a repeated theme: how to deal with negative comments and views regarding myself.  <br /><br />Some people’s assessments of me can be quite hurtful and for years, I have had these assessments passed to me through my loved ones and friends. It always feels like a mystery to me as my view of myself is one that suggests I am a person who is nearly always kind, open and caring, willing to help, and willing to set aside self in service to others.<br /><br />So, when I hear I am somehow not as good as I should be, that I hurt those I care about, and that those I am in relation to can ‘do better’,  I am stunned, actually.  I wish people could just say such things directly to me rather than go through my friends and loved ones. Such moments are serious teachers and I need to pay close attention to them.  As a result, I feel the need to sit down and shut up.<br /><br />So, for a while, I think I will.  <br /><br />Next week I am off to NY for a retreat with veterans and to visit with Claude Anshin.  I look forward to it.<br />Be well.
