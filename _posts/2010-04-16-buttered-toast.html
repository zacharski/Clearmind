With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br />Today is a sunny day with a threat of rain sometime. It would seem there is always a threat of something if we listen to the news.  I chose not to.  Whatever is there is there: my life is to meet it as completely as possible. Although I did not sleep well, I still woke at four and listened to the stillness of the early morning.<br /><br />My heart/mind is opening, but I sat Zazen early today troubled by my lack of sleep.  Sitting quietly, my eyes felt heavy, and I was mindful of a deep desire to just fall asleep there on the cushion. <br /><br />Let go, I say to myself.  Just be present.  An owl hoots.  A cockroach asks to be invited in.  I say no and invite him out. Another bird is warbling.  I consider my day: Zazen at Veteran’s Park at ten, coffee at Barnes and Nobles’ afterwards. An open afternoon presents itself although I will likely visit the hospital and the nursing home.<br /><br />And after that, nap and study time.<br /><br />But just now, buttered cinnamon-sugar toast awaits my mouth.  I am grateful indeed for the many hands and lives that bring such delicious foods to me!<br /><br />Be well, y’all.
