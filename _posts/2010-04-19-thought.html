With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br />Today I do some housekeeping details in order to leave early in the morning Tuesday for the Omega Institute.  There I will meet up with friend, Rev. Claude Anshin Thomas, and will practice with him for five days working with veterans within whom the thought of enlightenment has arisen. <br /><br />This thought is not a bad thing; thoughts are directions from our mind’s working.  Often in Zen we say, “well, it’s just a thought and thoughts have no substance.”  Some take this idea to mean we should dismiss thoughts altogether.  Nonsense.<br /><br />What is a challenge is to mistake a thought for more than it is and at the same time hold on to it as if it is truth itself.  A thought is an element of mental process, no more or less. <br /><br />The thought of enlightenment is the thought of resolution to our suffering: such a thing is a motivation for practice, but not the practice. If we want to run a marathon, for example, we must have more than a thought about it, but the thought is an essential first step in this very long process.<br /><br />So, tomorrow I fly to assist all beings in the next step. <br /><br />Be well.
