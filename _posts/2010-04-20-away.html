With palms together, <br /><br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br />  <br /><br />This morning I am on my way to Omega Institute in New York for a Veteran's retreat. I will return on the evening of the 26th.  I will try to stay in-touch as I can via the Internet. For those of you, who sit with me in Las Cruces; please enjoy your continued practice. I look forward to my return and our working together in zazen, private interview, and group discussion.   <br /><br />Up-coming projects include: Establishing Weekly Zen Discussion at Zendo on Fridays at 4:00 PM; establishing the Juarez Zen Center on Sundays at 11:00 AM; planning for Summer Sesshin in July; planning for two week Peace Village also in July.  <br /><br />Be well.
