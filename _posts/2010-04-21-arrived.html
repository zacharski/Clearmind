With palms together,<br /><br /><br /><br />Arrived in Newburgh, a town near the Institute, and am sitting in the airport Quiznos with three other vets.  We are anticipating the retreat and learning about each other.  One woman with sexual trauma, one Iraq war vet, and two Vietrnam vets: each of us in various states of repair. <br /><br /><br /><br />The retreat, I understand, is full, and it looks as though it will be a challenging week for all of us.
