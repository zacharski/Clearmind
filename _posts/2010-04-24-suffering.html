With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br />Morning arises with birdsong.  I am happy and grateful to be awake. This retreat is challenging as it is touching me very deeply.  So many people in such deep suffering.  I have spent much time listening. And walking. And sitting. And listening.  I am coming to conclude that the sufferings we experience, the injuries we receive, the hurts we feel: these are opportunities for grateful generosity.  Even if we are the perpetrators of the harm. When we open ourselves to the suffering within and around us and enter it as completely as possible, there resides our heart. Our humanity is in the beat of that heart. Without the gift of suffering no path such as this would be walked.  <br /><br />Listen deeply,<br />Be well.
