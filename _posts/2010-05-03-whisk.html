With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Last night, my son and his fiancé came over for dinner at Mokusho Dharma Center.  The condo has been transformed.  It is the temporary housing of Mokusho, but is nonetheless, a practice center inside and out.<br /><br />He picked up my fly whisk (hossu) and set it on his head asking if it helped.  I served him Dr. Brown’s Cream Soda and he returned the whisk to its place on the altar.     <br /><br />My hossu was offered to me by my Master, Rev. Hogaku-roshi, at my Dharma Transmission ceremony.  I have kept it close, but rarely pick it up, preferring instead the small, well worn, teaching kyosaku of Rev. Dr. Soyu Matsuoka-roshi, my Dharma Grandfather. They are each the same yet different.  <br /><br />Master Dogen cites as his very first koan, the case of Qingyuan’s Whisk. “Where are you from?” <br />“Caoxi” (the place where Hui Neng taught).<br />Qingyuan held up his hossu, “Do they have this in Caoxi?”<br /><br />What is being held up? It is just a stick with horse hair? Is it just a sliver of wood, sanded smooth?<br />Zen question, always:  “”what’s this?!”<br />Zen answer always, to quote Master Seung Sahn, “Open mouth, big mistake!”<br />Later in the Case, the master says, “It’s not that I mind saying something, but I fear it will be misunderstood later.”  On this point, Master Daido argues this master should be hit.<br />While silence is thunder, inaction in the face of need, is a grave error: no need to go somewhere to find something. The truth we need is within us always.<br /><br />Be well.
