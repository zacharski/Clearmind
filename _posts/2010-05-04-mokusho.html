With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />It is 43 degrees outside and I see evidence of the sun rising over the mountains. We will sit at Veteranâ€™s Park at 10:00 AM, although I am thinking of placing street practice Monday through Friday at 9:00 AM beginning next week.  In this way, all of our street Zen practices will begin at the same time (and place) and these will integrate with Sunday Zen Services at Mokusho Dharma Center, also beginning at 9:00 AM. <br /><br />Yesterday morning I completed the filing forms and mailed them to the State in order to become a State of New Mexico Non-profit corporation and I have an appointment to look at a space this afternoon for the Dharma Center. <br /><br />The space is near the Federal Building in downtown Las Cruces that will make it especially convenient for people.  Disciple KoMyo in California has made us a few gifts for the new Center: a set of Taku and a Han.  We will install the Han at our July sesshin.<br /><br />Mokusho Dharma Center plans to offer daily zazen, personal Zen instruction, weekly Zen Services, monthly Zazenkai, and quarterly Sesshin.  In addition we will offer Yoga and body shaping classes several times a week.  <br /><br />I am getting very excited about opening a new Dharma Center here in Las Cruces and look forward to working with you to bring about abundant peace in the world around us.<br /><br />Be well.
