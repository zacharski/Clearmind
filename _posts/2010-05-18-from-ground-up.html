With palms together,<br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />First, thank you Dai Shugyo and Colette for sitting with me yesterday and for watching the film, and for helping with the bookcases.  (Late last night I finished the first one and built a second one:  one more to go!))<br /><br /><br /><br />Second, thank you Bobby,Kankin Byrd, for being on Skype last night.  I really needed a friend to talk with.<br /><br /><br /><br />My student, Dai Shugyo, asked yesterday if it was something priests did, this sudden going into Zazenkai. I answered yes.<br /><br /><br /><br />We used to have a Zazenkai scheduled once a month. I still think it is a good idea, and even a better, a good practice.  One thing that happens over time with contemplative practice is that we become far more in touch with the deep, rolling, tides within us.  Small shifts open wide.<br /><br /><br /><br />I notice I am becoming very much more reclusive of late. It is importabt for me to pay attention to this, honor it, and practice with it.<br /><br /><br /><br />I believe part of it is that I am now alone and need to be alone.  In this space I find my heart/mind and allow it to express itself to me. Sometimes a whisper, other times a shout, this heart/mind is becoming my constant companion.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Throughout the day and night, I take a breath and open myself.  Feelings and thoughts come and go, as do the bodily sensations that are a part of the everyday experience of living.<br /><br /><br /><br />Zazenkai offers a short opportunity to pay attention longer and reside in the subtlties in such moments.<br /><br /><br /><br />And the point?  There is no point. It is said: <br /><br /><br /><br />Spring comes<br /><br />and the grass <br /><br />grows by itself.<br /><br /><br /><br />I choose to be<br /><br />its witness.  <br /><br /><br />Be well.<br /><br /><br />Rev.
