Coming Home: A Day for Survivors of War and Violence<br />Violence is a nasty business and has a way of turning lives upside down, shattering our understanding of ourselves, and making home life difficult. Returning combat veterans, and other survivors of violence, often suffer from symptoms of traumatic stress.  These symptoms are normal responses to abnormal circumstances.  They are uncomfortable and can be crazy-making.<br />Coming Home is a one-day experience for survivors suffering from the effects of violence, including post-traumatic stress, and will offer specific skills toward healing and recovery. Opportunities to learn practice skills based in the mindfulness practice of Zen will be offered and will include: Meditation, Deep Listening, Writing, Mindful Speech, Mindful Eating, and Movement Practices. Movement practices will include Yoga and T’ai Chi Chih. <br />Coming Home Practice is a project offered under the leadership of Zen monk, Rev. Dr. Harvey Daiho Hilbert-roshi, founder of the Order of Clear Mind Zen and a disabled Combat Veteran.  Daiho-roshi has worked with trauma survivors as a psychotherapist for nearly thirty years, was a consultant to the Veteran’s Administration, the Vietnam Veterans of America, and has written and published extensively on healing from the moral anguish of combat. Other facilitators include: Rev. Dalene Fulller Rogers, M. Div, is a Board Certified Expert on Traumatic Stress. Ms. Susie Citrin, RN is a Certified Yoga Instructor.  Rose Alvarez-Diosdado is an Accredited Instructor of T’ai Chi Chih. Reba Montero is Senior Dharma Teacher at Clear Mind Zen Temple and is a Teacher at the Unitarian Universalist Church.  Rev. Ken Hogaku McGuire-roshi is Daiho’s root teacher.<br />Come Home on June 19th at 9:00 AM at the Unitarian Universalist Church.   There is a minimal fee of $10.00 for food catered by during this workshop, but no charge for the workshop itself. Donations will gratefully be welcomed, however.  For additional information, reservation and registration, call Rev. Daiho at Clear Mind Zen, 575-680-6680 or email at sodaiho@hotmail.com.
