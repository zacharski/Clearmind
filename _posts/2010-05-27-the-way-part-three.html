The Buddha Precepts, Part Three<br />No stealing. I vow to respect the possessions of others. <br />No stealing goes far deeper than not taking a candy bar out of a store without paying for it.  It also refers to borrowing and not returning, borrowing without asking, and not caring for the boundaries of the world around us. <br />This precept speaks to relational life. Respect for the possessions of others enables  harmony in a community.  It enables order. Moreover, in Zen, this precept is often taught as “do not take what is not offered,” which points to still another view of the point. <br />Respect for gift and giving is essential. Our lives are not about gain, especially gain at the cost of others, but rather, our lives are about the generosity of flow. When offered a gift, receive it with deep respect, and then pass it along.  <br />Possessions might be thought of as brief encounters with duality. There true nature is not in their substance, but in their teaching.  What does having or not having mean?  What does needing or wanting mean?  Our response to the fact of possession is a critical teacher.  We must pay attention.<br />Be well.
