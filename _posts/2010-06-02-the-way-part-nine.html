The Buddha Precepts, Part Nine<br />Do not be greedy: Respect and value generosity of the material and spiritual.<br /><br />We do love our things, my things, your things, everybody’s things. No problem! Love values. Yet, when we want our things, need our things, when we cannot live without our things, big problem.  This precept teaches us that the way we live with our things is relational.  We live with our things by being generous with them.  Looking deeply, we see our things are not our things, that we have a hand on them only briefly and that they actually are the universe.  Understood in this way, generosity means letting go our grip on what we do not possess in the first place.  <br /><br />Greed is one of the three poisons, the Buddha taught.  Greed means possessiveness, it means aggrandizement, it means wanting more and more, even at the expense of others.  Greed is short sighted.  It separates us from others and diminishes our capacity to see clearly our interdependence.<br /><br />Greed involves both things material and spiritual.  As Zensters we offer ourselves to the universe. I offer you me, my time, my home, my heart, my dharma.  I do this in the form of opening. The Buddha taught that the antidote to this poison of greed is generosity or “dana.”  Dana paramita is the first paramita, the first perfection, if you will.  Dana releases us, frees us. <br /><br />The koan-like aspect of this practice knows we own nothing. How can we release anything?  If we release our material stuff, how do we live?  Am I to give you my house, my car?  In a manner of speaking, yes.  I do not possess my house; it possesses itself.  I do not possess my car; it too, possesses itself.  I am just the caretaker.  Most importantly, however, I practice not to let these things possess me.<br /><br />Generosity is a serious teacher, be its serious student.<br /><br />Respect and value generosity of the material and spiritual: Do not be greedy.
