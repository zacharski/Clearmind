The Buddha Precepts, Part Ten<br /><br />Do not get angry:  Respect and value tranquility of heart and mind.<br /><br />It is telling that the only feeling addressed in the Grave Precepts of Zen is anger.  We do not vow to be happy or vow not to be sad or afraid, but we do vow not to get angry. What is this about?<br /><br />Anger is a destructive feeling.  It separates rather than unites.  It enables us to do great harm and feel good about it in the process.  Most of all, anger blinds us.  Anger is one of the Buddha’s three poisons. Anger is a poison that takes away our sight, binds our reason, and kills our heart. <br /><br />In Zen, we take the attitude that we create our universe through our thoughts.  It is not that the universe does not exist apart from us, but what the universe is, what it means, is our creation. Our universe can be threatening and dangerous or it can be a peaceful refuge. We turn people into devils hell-bent on causing us harm one day and on another, those very same people can be our friends.  The universe and all that is in it are the same.  What changed are our thoughts about it. Change the thoughts; change the world…that’s what love’s got to do with it.<br /><br />Everyday situations can become quite toxic when we assign anger-provoking meanings to them. This person slighted us, that person cheated us, and so on. On the larger world stage, countries do the same:  this behavior is provoking, that behavior threatening. The resultant fear and anger allows us to justify aggression.<br /><br />Yet these moments can be wonderful opportunities to look more deeply into ourselves.  They invite investigation, not solution.  The tendency to respond in kind must be avoided.  We practice to remain open. If we are threatened, address the threat: check it out.  What is this feeling doing to me, to my morality, my ethic?   What about the situation is a threat?  Does the feeling of anger help or hinder me in this situation? <br /><br />If we really want serenity, peace of mind and body, we must be willing to take that backward step and accept ourselves on the cushion facing a wall. In truth, anger arises and anger falls away.  No need to pass it on.<br /><br />Be well.
