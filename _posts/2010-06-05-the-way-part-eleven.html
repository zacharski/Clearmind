The Buddha Precepts, Part Eleven<br />Do not speak ill of the Three Treasures: Respect and value all aspects of the Great Way.<br /> <br />This precept is a sort of capping verse to the whole enchilada. All of the precepts, indeed all moral behavior, flow from non-duality, the great Oneness of Everything That Is. To speak ill of any one part takes us away from our true selves and allows evil to arise.<br /><br />Old Homeless Kodo used to say, “The person who has left home must create his own life.”  The Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha are our refuge, they are the home we let arise when leaving home. They are our natural inherent state of being. It is said, ‘one minute Zazen, one minute Buddha; five minutes Zazen, five minutes Buddha. I say every moment Buddha  <br /><br />I say this because Buddha is universally present, it is only that we need open our eye to see.  To speak ill of the three Treasures is to duck with closed eye under the cover of delusion and wrap ourselves in the cloak of ignorance. When we understand the Buddha Way is not Buddhism, we understand it is every breath, every step, and everything we do throughout our day.  <br /><br />Be well.
