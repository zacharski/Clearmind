With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br />Mokusho Zen, Part Three<br /><br />Master Dogen writes, “If a human being, even for a single moment, manifests the Buddha’s posture in the three forms of conduct, while that person sits up straight in Samadhi, the entire world of Dharma assumes the Buddha’s posture, and the whole of space becomes the state of realization.” Bendowa, section 20 <br /><br />Dogen Zenji has said a mouthful with this utterance. In one broad stroke, he sets the stage for Every Moment Buddha practice. A little later in the text he says, “The practice is not confined to the sitting itself; it strikes space and resonates, (like) ringing that continues before and after a bell.” <br /><br />So, what is meant by manifesting the “Buddha’s posture”?  <br /><br />When we gather mind, body, and environment together and reside with them as one, we are manifesting the Buddha posture.  In this context, then it does not matter the “form of conduct” at all. We can be sitting, walking, or lying down.  In fact, as we live in this “Every Moment Buddha,” forms of conduct, body, minds, and environment, resolve into one seamless present. <br /><br />What to do next comes quite naturally, but never easily or clearly. For example, the other day I was talking with friends. These friends have been struggling with me since my separation. They report matters of loyalty to be the core issue between us.  I would agree in retrospect, although in the moment, I did not.  <br /><br />I have a new female friend and we are quite close.  These friends do not want me to visit them with her. Moreover, an invitation to dinner at my home would be rejected if she were present and, of course, an invitation to their home is for me to come alone. They claim this is due to their loyalty to my former partner, also their friend. It is clear to me that they are suffering and I feel badly for them.  They believe they need to make a choice as to where their “loyalties” lie.  The truth is such beliefs divide us rather than bring us together. <br /><br />People in such situations have divided themselves and suffer as a result.  Loyalty when used this way is hurtful, as it becomes a source of division and pain. Every Moment Buddha would have each of us together see through the other’s eyes, for the sake of deep understanding and connection.  Our heart opens as we become more inclusive and as we release ourselves from the grip of duality.  In this state, we are practicing Mokusho Zen.<br /><br /><br />Be well.
