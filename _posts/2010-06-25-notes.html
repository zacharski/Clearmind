With palms together, <br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br />This morning is Street Zen at Sagecrest Park. I enjoy very much sitting under the trees at this pleasant little park. Birds do their morning dances and people walk their dogs, gathering in small pockets of the park to share stories. <br /><br /><br /><br />Afterwards, I am going to T or C to talk with our webmaster. From there, its back to the Zendo for a Dokusan appointment followed by our weekly Zen Discussion Group at 4:00 PM. Everyone is welcome to attend. <br /><br /><br /><br />Sesshin approaches for the second weekend of July. We have space for one additional person at this point. Confirmed registrants include Daiho, Bussho, Zen Shin, Dai Shugyo, Soku Shin, and from California, Ko Myo, Casey Cochran, and John Sorenson. <br /><br />Donation for the weekend is $25.00. Meals included. <br /><br /><br /><br />Please register now if you want to attend. <br /><br /><br /><br />Lastly, we have availble copies of my booklet, "The Zen of Trauma" ($2.00) and the DVD short independent film, "Street Zen" ($12.00) . If you would like a copy, please email me. <br /><br /><br /><br />Thank you. <br /><br />Be well.
