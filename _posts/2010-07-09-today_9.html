With palms together,<br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This morning at 7:00 AM, we will practice Zen at Sagecrest Park on the corner of Roadrunner and Frontier and this afternoon our Zen discussion group will discuss the Hsin Hsin Ming (Faith Mind poem) of the Third Patriarch. This is an incredibly deep and profound teaching offered by the Dharma grandson of Master Bodhidharma. A copy can be found at our website: www.clearmindzen.org The group meets at 4:00 PM at the Condo Zendo.<br /><br /><br /><br />This evening at 7:00 PM we will begin our Obon Sesshin. Obon serves at least two purposes: a time to remember our deceased loved ones and a time to assist the Hungry Ghosts, those unfortunate ones who can never get enough and are thus always seeking and never receiving. During this period, we look for the Hungry Ghost in ourselves and treat him or her with great generosity and compassion. We will hold an Obon service on Sunday morning to offer cakes to the Hungry Ghosts. <br /><br /><br /><br />Let us practice to open the hand that grips us.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
