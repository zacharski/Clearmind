With palms together,<br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br />In the interest of full disclosure, it is dark outside. The candles in the Zendo are casting that warm light that they do under such conditions, almost begging for all other light sources to be excluded. The incense wafts through the room, as the open window allows a breeze. Desert air is always so refreshing in the morning.<br /><br /><br /><br />We are excited that the Order will finally have a home of its own. I will keep you posted.<br /><br /><br /><br />Today:<br /><br /><br /><br />7:00 AM Zazen at Zendo<br /><br />8:30 AM Peace Camp Zazen at TBE<br /><br />2:00 PM Dokusan with Ron at Zendo<br /><br />5:00 PM Dokusan with Shoji on Skype<br /><br />7:00 PM Zazen in Zendo<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
