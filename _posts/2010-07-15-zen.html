With palms together,<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />For me, Zen is nothing more than a process of unfolding. In such a process, there is nothing really to teach except the process itself. Each of us experiences the process individually and in our own way and time. What is essential is our attitude, or our stance, toward each moment as it arises.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Being open, allowing what we think is real and true to fall away, this is Zen.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This falling away may be sudden or gradual, but with practice it will happen. Some of us resist: who wants to be empty?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Some of us dive right in: who wants to be solid?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Most of us just practice, not at all concerned about outcome: this is the way.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
