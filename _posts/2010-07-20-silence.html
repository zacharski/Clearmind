With palms together,<br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Last night I sat in the darkened Zendo for some time. The Refuge has a bid on it and I spent a good deal of time mourning it’s loss. The house provided shelter in deep snow, coolness in summer heat, and solitude when most needed. It is time to move on.<br /><br /><br /><br />Zen is about staying awake in the present. My Teacher thinks I have been a bit cloudy of late. He says he is worried about me. Master-to-Master, we sit loving each other. A bow to him. <br /><br /><br /><br />I am not worried and I see clearly. It’s the dealing with what is seen that is at issue. So, I take a little piece of cloud and chew it up. Now another. And another. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />When the field is open<br /><br />And the sky is infinite, <br /><br />Sun and moon <br /><br />Mind them selves.<br /><br />The bell, about to ring,<br /><br />Makes no sound.<br /><br />The sun is about to rise:<br /><br />I sip my coffee.<br /><br /><br /><br />daiho<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
