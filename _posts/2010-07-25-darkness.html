With palms together,<br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />We so often stumble in the dark, when all that is required is that we turn on a light. So stubborn we human beings!<br /><br /><br /><br />We insist on walking in the dark, even relish it, and yet wonder how it is that we land on our butts so often.<br /><br /><br /><br />The problem is that we do not know we are walking in the dark. We donâ€™t know because we are sleep walking. Its easy. Just know everything.<br /><br /><br /><br />To know is to not know. Sounds paradoxical. Yet what is moonlight? If you say anything at all, it is incorrect. You are only blowing words out of your mouth. Thoughts out of your brain. No. To know moonlight is to be moonlight.<br /><br /><br /><br />How can we be moonlight? Sit outside tonight.<br /><br /><br /><br />Stumbling in the dark is easy; turning on the light? Well, that is a different story.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
