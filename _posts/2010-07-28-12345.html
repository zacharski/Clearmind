With palms together,<br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />“What are the teachings? ‘One, two, three, four, five!’” <br /><br />“What is practice? ‘In the whole world, it can never be hidden.’” <br /><br /><br /><br />This teaching comes from Dogen Zenji’s Tenzo Kyokun (Instructions for the Cook). <br /><br /><br /><br />Here we have a direct lesson in living in the Way. The teachings point to lessons as plain as the nose on our face, the question is, can we see our nose? <br /><br /><br /><br />We often say, “When washing the dishes, just wash the dishes.” When I wash the dishes it is a great lesson in mindfulness. My left hand, partially paralyzed, refuses to hold things in soapy water. So, I must consciously and deliberately find a way to hold the glass while washing it with my other, “good,” hand. <br /><br /><br /><br />In this simple everyday task is a very deep teaching: washing the glass is none other than one, two, three, four, five. Practice awareness is “things whether slippery and wet, or dry as a bone, are none other than the universe itself: exercise great care.” The buddha way is nothing more than this. <br /><br /><br /><br />I am grateful for my paralysis, though at times it is a clear pain in the ass. It is a dharma gate. Without it, I would be able to wash the dishes without putting attention on the dishes. I would be able to put on my kesa without struggling to tie it. I would be able to tie my shoes without feeling like Captain Hook. Things would definitely be easier, but mindlessness would be knocking at my door. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
