With palms together,<br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />It is the end of the month and that means two things: time to practice takuhatsu (begging) and time for Zazenkai. Our Order will move into its Temple Building this month. We exist from donations. All of our services are free and open to the public. Unfortunately the products and services we consume in the process are not free. Our rent there is $560.00 which includes utilities. The Order, instead of paying me a salary, pays for the equipment and services I use on behalf of the Order. These include gasoline, cell phone and Internet service. In addition, there are tea, coffee, and small amounts of food for events such as Zen Discussion Group, Zazenkai, etc. Together, these equal about $300.00 per month, which means our budgeted financial needs are $860.00. <br /><br /><br /><br />Dana (charity) is our very first perfection. Please consider a tax-deductible donation to our new Temple. <br /><br /><br /><br />Also, we are in desperate need of basic supplies like zafus and an inkan bell. If you have an old zafu and consider donating it, please do so. Or, if you would rather not make a cash donation, go online to a zafu company and order one on our behalf.<br /><br /><br /><br />Coming next week is Hiroshima/Nagasaki Memorial Day (August 5). We will offer a one-day Zazenkai on the first Saturday of August in memorial to this dreadful event. As a part of the Zazenkai, we will show a film called “Atomic Flame” which is the story of a flame kindled by the A-bomb that devastated Nagasaki and was kept burning for sixty years, finally to be returned to its source at Trinity Site here in New Mexico. Members of our Sangha participated in the ceremony. <br /><br /><br /><br />Zazenkai will begin at 7:00 AM and close at 4:00 PM Please RSVP. Thank you.
