With palms together,<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />A few announcements:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />We now have the key to the Temple. We plan to move the Zendo, the library/office/Dokusan room and the kitchen on Sunday Morning so there will not be services. The Temple will be operational on Monday the 16th. Internet service is scheduled for set-up on Monday, but there is a question as to whether or not there is a receptacle for the modem.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I would like us to host an Open House on Friday, August 20 from 4:00 to 7:00 PM. This will allow attendees to try a period of zazen at our evening practice period. Volunteers will be greatly appreciated.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />We will have two ads a month for two months in the Las Cruces Sun. We will follow these with one a month in after that. These ads will be located in the Worship Directory.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I have prepared a rough wooden sign that will be set in the ground as soon as I can do it. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Our Friday discussion group will meet at the condo zendo today at 4:00.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The Temple will show the film, "Zen" at the "Center for Spiritual Living" in the downtown mall on Friday September 3rd from 7:00 PM to 9:30 PM. We will consider this the beginning of Ohigan Sesshin and start with an opening ceremony.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Ohigan Sesshin begins Friday the 3rd and will continue through Sunday afternoon. The first evening will be at the Center for Spiritual Living. Sesshin will continue at the Temple thereafter.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />On September 21, we will participate in the United Nations International Day of Peace celebration It will be an evening of music, however, the program will open with roundtable discussions. I will moderate the group addressing the question, "What is Peace?" Last year we had approximately 400 people in attendance. We are expecting 600 this year.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Lastly, I am considering restarting a street Zen practice at the Federal building on Wednesday afternoons from 5-6:00 PM. Those who might be interested in sitting with me, please let me know.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Be Well.
