With palms together,<br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br />“Trying to find a buddha or enlightenment is like trying to grab space. Space has a name, but no form. …The buddha is a product of your mind.” So says Bodhidharma in his Bloodstream Sermon. He goes on to say, “To find a buddha, you have to see your own nature. Whoever sees his nature is a buddha.”<br /><br /><br /><br />If you should meet someone who claims to be a buddha or enlightened, offer prayers for them, they are deluded. To see our own nature is to see emptiness and emptiness has no name. Again Bodhidharma, “If you envision a buddha, a dharma, or a bodhisattva and conceive respect for them, you relegate yourself to the realm of mortals. …The sutras say, “That which is free of all form is the buddha.””<br /><br /><br /><br />So, then what is a buddha? Your own true nature. There is nowhere to go with that. Nothing to do with that. Nothing that can be said about that. <br /><br /><br /><br />When we touch that impermanence, there are no words that can capture it and no words to describe it: in fact, words destroy it. <br /><br /><br /><br />Practice and allow buddha entry into the world.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
