With palms together,<br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Last night I came “home” to a leather sofa with a hole in its corner: Suki did it. She is now spending her days in her cage. Somehow, I need to repair that sofa. My Daughter-in-Law suggested an automotive store. She knows things like this. So, sometime today I will visit the Auto Zone. <br /><br /><br /><br />Anyway, I got to the Temple and opened her up at 6:00 AM. Zazen at 7:00 was followed by a talk with a neighbor who is very interested in Zen. I handed him a flier and invited him to visit us for Zazen.<br /><br /><br /><br />We just need to be here. People will come and when they do, they will expect someone to be here to listen to them and to offer them instruction.<br /><br /><br /><br />At 10:00 AM, I will meet a friend who will help me move bookcases and possibly our futon. Then I will attend a Clergy Lunch. <br /><br /><br /><br />I want to thank all of you who assisted us in moving into the Temple: Reba, Joe, Ken, Celia, Colette, and now Ken S. You are all bodhisattvas.<br /><br /><br /><br />Such a wonderful life this is. <br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
