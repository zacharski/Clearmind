With palms together,<br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br />This morning I woke at 4:00 AM. I got the coffee going, picked up a bit, took a quick shower, and enjoyed being still. There is something about the stillness of early morning that is healing. I really benefit from such time. It’s like a recovery period.<br /><br /><br /><br />Yesterday was a challenging day for a variety of reasons I won’t go into in detail. Suffice to say I experienced anticipation and expectation as true causes of suffering.<br /><br /><br /><br />The advice I give to myself when feeling overwhelmed or frustrated is, a. Take a break, and b. Relax into stillness. Allowing my breath to just come and go as it does, I am able to begin to appreciate everything in view. It is mindful attention in the given moment.<br /><br /><br /><br />Now, just now, <br /><br /><br /><br />Be well
