With palms together,<br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br />My partner is beside me and she is pretending not to be interested in what I am writing. I know better. It has been a joyous reunion. She looks much healthier and is so much more alive. We have a very special, if not outside the pale, relationship. We have not seen each other for two months time.<br /><br /><br /><br />In Zen, the universe is one. There is no outside, no inside; just this that is there in front of us. Unlike Stephen Hawking, it does not care whom or what (if anything at all) created it: it simply is. In thusness we turn and face ourselves. How are we doing? Is our life of benefit to others? How are we treating one another? Can we die in this moment without hesitation? <br /><br /><br /><br />Labels and boxes are the stuff of duality: they are fingers pointing to delusion. I say, drop them and be free. <br /><br /><br /><br />Travel at the speed of thought, <br /><br />And find yourself <br /><br />Looking at yourself: <br /><br />There is no tomorrow <br /><br />No yesterday. <br /><br />No now. <br /><br />There is just what we make <br /><br />In our next breath. <br /><br /><br /><br />So, we touch each other over a time and distance which does not exist, and in the flash of a thought we will bring love into the world. <br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
