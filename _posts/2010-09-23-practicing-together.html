With palms together,<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Last night student Luisa sat with me at the 7:00 PM zazen period. This morning student Mu Shin sat with me at the 7:00 AM period. Suki stayed in her bed. It is good to sit with others. There is something about the energy of people practicing together that supports us in our own individual practice. After Mu Shin left, I sipped coffee, then welcomed Teacher Ken Hogaku-roshi into our Temple where he set about completing a construction job in the zendo. I took Suki to Pioneer women’s Park and we walked our single loop. It had rained last night and there were huge puddles for Suki to play in. She was a joyful mess by the end of our walk.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Sangha is key to successful practice. Successful practice is any practice that is done in mindfulness both in a zendo and out. Practice within a sangha is a means of learning to be mindful of others and our relational interactions. It requires us to get out of ourselves, to open our hearts, and practice generosity of spirit.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />We do not always want to go to a temple, center, or park to practice. It is so much easier to just sit down in our room and practice there. We can be lazy buddhas. This is not the way. True practice requires the discipline of going to a group for practice. Then when we say, “I take refuge in the sangha.” we mean it. At a practice center we experience renunciation of self and open ourselves to the energy of others.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />We practice at Clear Mind Zen Temple at 7:00 AM, 2:00 PM, and 7:00 PM Monday through Friday, at 9:00 AM on Wednesday, and at 9:00 AM on Sunday. In addition, we sit in the park at 9:00 on Monday and Friday. We also provide two forms of contemplative practices in motion: T’ai Chi Chih at 4::00 PM on Wednesday and Gentle Yoga at 4:30 on Thursday.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why not join us?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
