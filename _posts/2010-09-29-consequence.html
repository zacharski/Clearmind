With palms together<br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />There are no consequences: a simple, but powerful, sentence. This does not mean that “bad” things do not follow “bad” things, or that “good” things do not follow “good” things, but rather, it means:<br /><br />1. things are what they are, in the moment they are, <br /><br />2. and when we are one with (and in) them, notions such as good, bad, right, wrong, past, future, are meaningless. <br /><br /><br /><br />Consequence assumes linearity of time and a dualistic separation of subject and object. When we reside in the moment, we are residing in the moment as it is. <br /><br /><br /><br />Some might argue that if there were no consequences, that is, no separation between subject and object and perception of linear time, we might misbehave, run amok, and otherwise cause grievous devastation. To them I say, “Look around.” Living in dualism with consequentialist ethics has not shown us much. <br /><br /><br /><br />What is the alternative? Simple really, live precisely, exactly, and squarely in this moment. Focus your complete attention on your intention in the situation, not the consequence. Consequence, karma, is what it is: do not be afraid. Here is the thing. When we practice, when there is no self, no ego-driven intention, behavior can be other-centered. When our intention is other-centered, love can arise, compassion can be present, and our fear falls away. <br /><br /><br /><br /><em>With no hindrance in the mind, no fear</em>.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be here now.
