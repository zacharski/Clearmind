With palms together<br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />It is oâ€™dark thirty and I am awake. What else is there to say? Mornings are indescribably delicious to me: the cool air, the silence, and time pregnant with opportunity.<br /><br /><br /><br />This morning we will practice Zazen. Throughout the day, we will practice mindfulness. It is our way <br /><br /><br /><br />With an eye to what is next to do, I am aware that my eye is on what next to do: bring it back, bring it back. The processes of Zen are the same: simple but difficult. Keep your mind, mindfully. <br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
