With palms together<br /><br /><br />Good Evening Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br />My dog, Suki, has buddha nature. I know this because watching her intently; I see generosity, patience, diligence, morality, mindfulness, and most importantly, wisdom. She is but a pup, yet there she is, a living buddha. I am fortunate indeed to have her at my side. <br /><br /><br /><br />Suki manifests the great paramitas, those aspects of a buddha we seek to release through our practice. I wish I were able to release such fine attributes, but alas, I am human.<br /><br /><br /><br />My practice will be Suki watching, or more precisely, watching myself experience Suki.<br /><br /><br /><br />This is all we can do in life: witness in the most profound and deepest sense that which gives rise to the thought of enlightenment. As we go about our daily business, we witness ourselves in our small preoccupations and, once in awhile, if we are both fortunate and observant, a Suki moment taps us on the shoulder.<br /><br /><br /><br />May yours be in this moment.
