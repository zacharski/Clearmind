With palms together<br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br />The Non-duality Rag<br /><br />So, this morning a cold wind<br /><br />slipped across my skin<br /><br />from the open window. <br /><br />I snuggled with Suki. <br /><br />She, too, seemed to feel it <br /><br />and sought the warmth <br /><br />of my body. <br /><br />We care. <br /><br />That is a good thing.<br /><br /><br /><br />Last night <br /><br />I watched a documentary <br /><br />by the Dalai Lama <br /><br />on the Four Noble Truths. <br /><br />In his introductory comments, <br /><br />as he so often does, <br /><br />he said every world religion <br /><br />has the potential to create nice human beings. <br /><br />He defined this “nice” <br /><br />as being caring and compassionate. <br /><br /><br /><br />Yes, our practice <br /><br />is to manifest care and compassion. <br /><br />We are nice. <br /><br />Such a way of being <br /><br />requires others. <br /><br />Without others, <br /><br />no compassion is possible. <br /><br />Without others, <br /><br />no caring is possible. <br /><br />Others are essential.<br /><br /><br /><br />This is why we can say <br /><br />there is no caring <br /><br />and there is no compassion. <br /><br />There is just <br /><br />caring and compassion. <br /><br />I cannot care for you; I care. <br /><br />I cannot be compassionate for you; I am compassion.<br /><br /><br /><br />Then it gets really weird: <br /><br />where is this “I” that cares? <br /><br />Seeking this so-called I, <br /><br />it cannot be found. <br /><br />Just a whisper<br /><br />in my mind’s ear, <br /><br />“here I am!” <br /><br /><br /><br />Where? Nowhere.<br /><br /><br /><br />Shall we live by a whisper?
