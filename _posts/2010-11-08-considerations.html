With palms together<br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />In the beginning, God spoke, and everything came into being. Or so they say.<br /><br /><br /><br />In such a view, God stands outside of time, but since time and being are one, this could not be. So being happened and with it, God came into existence. Consider this.<br /><br /><br /><br />We ask, well what caused being to happen? We answer nothing. Before being happened, nothing existed, including time. Cause, therefore, also could not have existed. Consider this.<br /><br /><br /><br />We say, well there was the original material of the universe. We answer, can anything “be” without a perception? In the instant the universe appeared, cosmic consciousness appeared and with it, matter appeared. Consider this.<br /><br /><br /><br />In the relative view, we are but a part of an infinite network of connections which gives rise to the view of no parts, just one. When we reside in no parts, wholeness, parts, and everything else drops away. What is left?<br /><br /><br /><br />Just this.
