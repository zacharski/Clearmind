With palms together<br /><br /><br />Good Afternoon Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Zen is easily understood, but had to attain. The easy is that it is direct. Want to know? Experience directly. There is absolutely nothing mystical about it. So, if it is so easy, then why do we need all the words, why do we talk a seeming double-talk? The truth is, we donâ€™t and too often the words get between us and our attainment of the moment. Thinking about something is not the thing. Painting a picture is not the thing. Graphs, charts, and pointers are not the thing. Each of these are creations of our mind to make a picture of that which cannot be spoken, drawn, or otherwise communicated. <br /><br /><br /><br />Easy, but hard. <br /><br /><br /><br />The easy part is just experiencing ourselves. The hard part is letting go of the idea that there should be something more. We want more. We want fancy. We want mystical. Such things make us feel special. But we are not special and Zen is nothing special. <br /><br /><br /><br />Drop away from special. Live your life as it is. <br /><br /><br /><br />Easy, but hard. So it goes.
