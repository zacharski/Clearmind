With palms together<br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br />Preparations are in full swing for sesshin. The California Sangha arrived safely yesterday and are now busy getting things ready. The Tenzo, who is the abbot of the Texas Sangha, will arrive in a couple of hours. It is very exciting to see so much activity at the Temple!<br /><br /><br /><br />Today at CMZT we did Zen at Veteranâ€™s Park at 9:00 AM followed by the samu of completing the altar platform. Afterwards, we will check the oryoki bowls sets and then prepare for our weekly Zen discussion group at 4:00 PM. Rohatsu sesshin begins at 7:00 PM. We will be sitting through the weekend until noon on Sunday. Sunday Zen service is at 9:00 AM. <br /><br /><br /><br />I will not write to you over the weekend. May you be a blessing in the universe. <br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
