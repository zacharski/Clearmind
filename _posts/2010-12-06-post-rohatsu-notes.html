With palms together<br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br />Rohatsu sesshin concluded with a wonderful luncheon dinner at the Village Inn. If anyone has pictures of the ceremonies or of the group afterwards, please email one or two of them to me. Sesshin was attended by fourteen of us: four from the American River Sangha in Sacramento, CA., two from Both Sides/No Sides Sangha in El Paso, one from Deming, NM, and the rest from Las Cruces, NM.<br /><br /><br /><br />Ceremonies included three Kie Sanbo Tokudo and one Jukai Tokudo: congratulations to Susan “Hakushi” Beckett (student of Priest Kajo), Heather “Kishin” Ogston (student of Priest Komyo), Kathi “Ryugin” Sorenson, and John “Shoji” Sorenson (students of Priest Daiho).<br /><br /><br /><br />A highlight of the sesshin was a somewhat unorthodox activity. We each wrote out a commentary on our Dharma name. If we were not yet in possession of such a name, participants were asked to consider what they might think their name would be. It seemed this exercise was deeply touching and emotionally moving. Silence was maintained for the most part, but it did take a slap of the kyosaku on the Roshi’s desk once to make the point.<br /><br /><br /><br />Our Tenzo, Rev. Bobby Kankin Byrd, did a superlative job addressing the needs of the sangha. We only heard one yelp when he dropped an egg on the floor and the food was delicious. <br /><br /><br /><br />My aim during this sesshin was to stay out of the leadership role as much as possible, allowing my able Kansu, Rev. Komyo, to take the lead. He did a terrific job and I am very pleased with the overall outcome. One of the things I did learn coming out of this experience was a procedure book, a “Shingi,” might be a good idea for our Order. I have been slowly developing this, but I can see I need to make it a priority. <br /><br /><br /><br />May each of us be a blessing in the universe today.<br /><br /><br /><br />Yours,
