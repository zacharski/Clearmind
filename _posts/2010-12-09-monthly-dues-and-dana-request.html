Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />We have had a very good year with lots of Temple building and Sangha building efforts. Feedback has been nothing but positive. Our sesshin fees are very, very low at $25.00 for a full weekend. I am suggesting we increase these fees to $50.00.<br /><br />This is the last month of the year. For those who wish to offer dana to the Temple, please do so, we are always in need. I think it would be wonderful if those who consider themselves sangha members make a monthly pledge. <br /><br />I propose the following:<br /><br />Friend of the Order: $5.00 per month <br /><br />Associate Member: $10.00 per month<br /><br />Member: $25.00 per month.<br /><br />Sustaining Member: $50.00 per month<br /><br />Great Benefactor; $75:00 + per month.<br /><br />Friends, Associates, and Members will pay $25.00 for sesshin/zazenkai/retreats and will be asked for $25.00 for any ordination ceremony<br /><br />Sustaining Members will pay $15.00 for sesshin/zazenkai/retreats and will be asked for $15.00 for any ordination ceremony.<br /><br />Great Benefactors will pay nothing for any service offered by the Temple.<br /><br />Application:<br /><br />Yes, I want to be a part of the Order of Clear Mind Zen<br /><br />Please enroll me at this level:<br /><br />____Friend of the Order: $5.00 per month<br />____Associate Member: $10.00 per month<br />____Member: $25.00 per month.<br />____Sustaining Member: $50.00 per month<br />____Great Benefactor; $75:00 + per month.<br /><br /><br /><br />Regular dana will help us to firm up our budget for the coming year. So, please complete this&nbsp;form and return it as soon as posible to <a href="mailto:harveyhilbert@yahoo.com">harveyhilbert@yahoo.com</a><br /><br />Thank you.
