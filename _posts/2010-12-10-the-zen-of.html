With palms together,<br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br />When we talk about Zen, we do not talk about Zen. Zen is impossible to actually talk about. Its rather like the Dao, if it can be spoken, its not the Dao. We “talk about” rather than experience. Zen is not even to be experienced, though, as to experience it is to be it and to be it means there is no one separate from it. All of our talk should be nothing more than fingers pointing to it: we must release ourselves into it and the “it” I refer to is reality. <br /><br /><br /><br />As Daido Loori-roshi pointed out, there are many Gates of Zen. He catalogued eight, but in fact, there are myriad gates. If our attitude is correct, anything we do is a dharma gate. My use of attitude here is similar to the one used by pilots of aircraft where attitude is four-dimensional.<br /><br /><br /><br />To enter the gate, we must release ourselves. This release is really very simple, children do it all the time, as do adults: we all just are not aware that it is what we are doing when we are doing it. What is it we are doing? <br /><br /><br /><br />I remember riding my horse, Shaker. When we were training, doing figure eights, tighter and tighter, or when I was lunging her in the round pen, I would become her. Every muscle of hers and mine were merged, completely integrated to the point where we were one. Not only we were one, but this new “oneness” was one with time and space, which is to say, there was no circle, no figure eight, no round pen, as all of it, circle, horse, and rider were one. Mind was no more. Everything was instantaneous and completely there. Only by trusting myself and my horse was I able to release myself into her and space. I call this trust faith. Cowboy Zen.<br /><br /><br /><br />Do not mistake this. You don’t need a horse, nor do you need to be a cowboy. Artists know this, motorcyclists know this, bicyclists and runners know this. This is why we have so many books with title like “The Zen of…” They all come to the same thing: release yourself, let go of your grip, and enter reality fully and completely.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.<br /><br /><br /><br />Today at Clear Mind Zen Temple: 9:00 AM Zen in the Veteran’s Park; Zen Discussion Group at 4:00 PM at the Temple; Zazen at 5:30 in the Zendo. Our discussion will focus on “The Structure of Buddhism” as outlined by Zen Master Seung Sahn in his Compass of Zen.
