With palms together<br /><br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />So, the morning arrives with a whisper. I shave my head and clean the razor, make the coffee and read my morning mail. It is a typical morning, but for the hour. For some reason I woke at about 2:30 AM…it might be due to the fact that I went to sleep just after dark. Hmmm, note to self, try not to do that.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I re-read that post by Naomi Wolf from Huffington. I then took a look at the Espionage Act itself and how it has been enforced, as well as some other acts. The Military Commissions Act of 2006, for example, gives the president or his appointee the power to declare anyone (including ordinary American citizens) an “enemy combatant.” I fear Naomi Wolf is onto something. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Here are her ten steps to a closed society:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />10 steps that close an open society<br /><br /><br /><br />1. invoke an internal and external threat<br /><br /><br /><br />People who are afraid are willing to do things that they wouldn’t otherwise do. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />2. establish secret (unaccountable) prisons where torture takes place<br /><br /><br /><br />In a secret system, the government does not have to provide any proof of wrongdoing by those it holds, so it can incarcerate anyone it wants. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />3. develop a paramilitary force<br /><br /><br /><br />A private military force — under the exclusive direction of the “commander in chief” with no accountability to Congress, the courts, or the public — blurs the line between a civilian police force and a militarized police state. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />4. surveil ordinary citizens<br /><br /><br /><br />People who believe they are being watched are less likely to voice opposition. To scare a population into silence, the government need only monitor the activities of a few to make everyone fear that they are being surveilled. Every closed society keeps a “list” of so-called opponents it tracks. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />5. infiltrate citizen’s groups<br /><br /><br /><br />Spies in activist groups put psychological pressure on genuine activists by undermining their trust in one another. They may also disrupt legal activities, undermining the effectiveness of group efforts. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />6. detain and release ordinary citizens<br /><br /><br /><br />Detention intimidates or psychologically damages those arrested and also lets everyone know that anyone could be labeled an “enemy combatant” and “disappeared.” <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />7. target key individuals<br /><br /><br /><br />People are less likely to speak out when those who are highly visible, like journalists, scholars, artists, or celebrities, are intimidated or have the livelihoods threatened. Targeting those who are especially visible makes it less likely that people will speak out and robs society of leaders and others who might inspire opposition. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />8. restrict the press<br /><br /><br /><br />The public is less likely to fi nd out about government wrongdoing if the government can threaten to prosecute anyone who publishes or broadcasts reports that are critical of the government. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />9. recast criticism as espionage and dissent as treason<br /><br /><br /><br />People who protest can be charged with terrorism or treason when laws criminalize or limit free speech rather than protect it. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />10. subvert the rule of law<br /><br /><br /><br />The disappearance of checks and balances makes it easier to declare martial law, especially if the judiciary branch continues to exercise authority over individuals but has no authority over the Executive branch.<br /><br /><br /><br />See http://www.huffingtonpost.com/naomi-wolf/ten-steps-to-close-down-a_b_46695.html<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />What does this have to do with Zen? Everything. We cannot practice in a closed society. Our society is becoming less and less tolerant as we become more and more frightened. A piece on the BBC just pointed out the difficulties with religious garb, for example, when the TSA deciided an Indian ambassador needed to be both patted down and have his head covering searched I was patted down myself when I refused to remove my rakusu. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />A free society is a living society, a closed society is a dying society. Open societies, while tumultuous at times, are vibrant, healthy, and willing to take the risks freedom requires. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Where do you suppose we might be?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Be well, be free.
