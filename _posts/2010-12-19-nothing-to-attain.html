With palms together<br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />In the Heart Sutra we are told that everything is empty. Everything changes, that is, so nothing is either what it appears to be or what it is. We have no eye, ear, nose, tongue, no body, no mind and therefore there is no seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting or touching, and no thinking. Yet, there they are when we look in a mirror: eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. When we practice Zazen, when we enter the stillpoint, these fall away, meaning we experience truth.<br /><br /><br /><br />In the largest context all things are not things at all. All is one, nothing is separate. This thing over against that thing is an illusion perpetrated on us by our brain. Yet, even so, when entering the stillpoint, even one is no more. For one to have any reality, there must be another, two. So, not even one is real: no wisdom and no attainment; there is nothing to attain.<br /><br /><br /><br />This morning we practice Zazen at 9:00 AM in the Zendo. The Zendo is home to the Sangha. Please join us.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />P.S. Last night I had a candle accident, melting some wax on the office carpet. Any ideas as to how to get it up?
