With palms together<br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br />This morning I am awake to the sounds of silence. What sounds are those? The sound of no-sound. No-sound is the sound of presence. Just this, as it is, with nothing added. <br /><br /><br /><br />No-sound, like no-seeing or no-thinking, is a serious challenge for us and so it is core to our practice. <br /><br /><br /><br />When we walk and we think we are walking are we walking? Is this Zen in motion? Or is Zen in motion just walking? Consider this. <br /><br /><br /><br />When I say I am awake to the sound of silence, to no-sound, it simply means there is no I in the “I am.” “I am” is nothing more or less than a fiction derived from language. How can this be? Where is the “I” in the sudden close-by crack of thunder? Practice no-sound. Practice no-I. <br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.<br /><br /><br /><br />A reminder: Tai Chi Chih today at 4:00, Zazen at 7:00 PM
