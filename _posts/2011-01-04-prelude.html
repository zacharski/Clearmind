With palms together<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Already it is a lovely morning. The temperature is a reasonable 32 degrees with signs that it will rise into the 50s. The sky is a clear blue. The sun is beginning to peak over the mountains. I have my running clothes laid out and ready. The coffee just finished being made. All is right here in the Mesilla Valley.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Zen is like that. Everything is itself. No pretense. Pretense is an anathema to true Zen. The coffee is made. A Zen teaching. The sun is in the sky. A Zen teaching. And the teaching itself? Life is to be lived and experienced directly. We do not shy away from this or that; this or that is our life.<br /><br /><br /><br />So, time for a run. Let's do it!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
