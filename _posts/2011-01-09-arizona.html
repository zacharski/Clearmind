With palms together,<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The comments in the comments sections of the news stories regarding the Arizona shootings make me feel as sick as the actual shootings. Liberal loonies, Right wing fascists, Dumb this, Stupid that, each polarized side blaming the other and, in the process, ratcheting up the already high emotion. Are liberals to blame? Are conservatives accountable? Can we actually talk to one another these days?<br /><br /><br /><br />Violence and threats of violence seem to be part of the political landscape at this point. Packages are igniting, rocks thrown, bullets fired, all over what? How to be a better society? I think not. We live in (and support) a culture of violence in both word and deed. We should not be surprised by recent events.<br /><br /><br /><br />Our media share a lot of responsibility in the current situation. Television networks like Fox News and MSNBC, conservative radio programs like Rush Limbaugh and Michael Savage, liberal commentators on Air America, commentators who use sarcasm and poison to get position and ratings, all share in this. Yet, we can hear it now: “We can’t be responsible for ‘nut cases.’ “ No? Why not? Every media outlet knows ‘nut cases’ are out there and the media mentioned plays to them. It’s like saying we poured gasoline on a tinderbox and jumped up and down regarding the tinderbox itself and then said, “We have no responsibility” in the lighting of the match that sends it into flames. Right.<br /><br /><br /><br />If we are to remain a civilized world (and this status is, at this point, questionable) we must be willing to listen to each other and get to the source of each other’s point of view. I fear at this stage of the process, the political landscape, which is to say, the landscape of every one of us, has been stained with hate. It is very challenging to be in the presence of those who dislike or hate us. Even more challenging to be willing to listen to their point of view with an open heart/mind.<br /><br /><br /><br />Both Left and Right need to be less left or right and more for the common good. Precious little of that is evident these days. Yet, under it all, moral conscience is the fuel. We want to be a better society and have been de-railed by those who would rather have hot tempers gain ratings than cool heads solving problems. Maybe it is time to sit down together and shut up. Maybe it is time to listen and allow ourselves to care with compassion.<br /><br />Be well<br /><br /><br /><br />Rev.
