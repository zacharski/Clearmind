With palms together,<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Two notes:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Tomorrow we will host Both Sides/No Sides Zen Sangha's Zazenkai and Jukai ceremonies. Rev. Bobby Kankin Byrd will lead the Zazenkai and his students, Kathryn Soku Shin Masaryk and Mike Dretsch will receive the precepts at 4:30. This event includes Oryoki lunch. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Please consider joining us for all or part of the day, but let me know if you are attending so that we can get an accurate count for lunch.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Today at Clear Mind Zen Temple: We will practice Contemplative Yoga at 3:00 PM, our Zen Dicussion group will meet at 4:00 PM, and we will practice Zazen at 5:30 PM.
