<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With palms together,<br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />Last night we went to see a little theatre production of ”Crime and Punishment.” It was typically Russian. The actor’s “book” must have been seriously overwhelming as the play was a playground of words and the ideas they reflect. Actually, it was more a park than playground, with the slow moving Russian author filling long dark winters with monologue as he sat on benches or walked slowly along a winter’s path. Too cold for dialogue and lively would be unheard-of.<br /><br /><br /><br />In any event, the play was wonderful and the acting superior to anything I have seen in that theatre since I’ve lived in Las Cruces. The director’s blocking was interesting and allowed some movement in the otherwise still, inner reflection, of the characters.<br /><br /><br /><br />It was particularly delightful to be there to support fellow Zen monk, Algernon D’Ammassa. Algernon is a Zen priest in the Korean Zen tradition and lives in Deming, NM. He proved to be a serious actor who brought depth and maturity to the stage.<br /><br /><br /><br />On the downside of the evening, we ran into a couple who were our friends in our former lives. My (apparently) former friend ignored me when I said hello in the lobby. This is so sad. A retired clergyman, I expected he would rise to the occasion and say hello in return allowing a degree of normalization to occur. Instead, he coldly walked past us with wife in tow, eyes cast down.<br /><br /><br /><br />Holding on to past hurt and anger is not healthy and inhibits our grown as human beings. The past serves little useful purpose in the present and clearly distorts and clouds the array of possible behavioral choices in the moment, disallowing any possible healing.<br /><br />.<br /><br />Apropos, the thematic line of the play was, “do you believe a man can rise from the dead?” In other words, can we be reborn in the moment and offer ourselves in a new way in the present? Is redemption possible? <br /><br /><br /><br />My answer? Absolutely, but only with a willingness to shed the skin of the self.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.<br /><br /></div>
