<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With palms together,<br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />The aim of practice is practice itself and practice itself is to wake up. How hard is this? Very. It requires our every moment awareness, diligence, and effort. We practice; we live. We fail to practice; we die. <br /><br /><br /><br />In Zen, life and death have nothing to do with breathing, cell division, or metabolism. Life and death are synonymous with awake or asleep. Awake we see the big picture; asleep we reside in the details. Just as everything asleep needs to wake up; everything awake needs sleep.<br /><br /><br /><br />What is the big picture? What are the details? These are the questions that arise through our practice, these are the things, the body and mind, that fall away.<br /><br /><br /><br />It is cold; it is not cold; cold is our mind creating cold. When one, cold and hot disappear. Body and mind fall away. Awake we need no coat; asleep we need a coat.<br /><br /><br /><br />Just so, what is practice? <br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.<br /><br /></div>
