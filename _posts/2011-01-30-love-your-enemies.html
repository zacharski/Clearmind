<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With palms together,<br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br />Events in distant lands are troublesome. Political unrest, religious oppression, killing, all seem rampant. There is a degree of inhumanity and intolerance that just seems plain wrong. I read a story of the brutal stoning deaths of a couple in Pakistan, the hanging of a woman in Iran, and the beating death of a gay man in Africa. Of course, we in the US have our share: the killing of a father and daughter in Arizona by vigilantes, and this morning, I read about a mother who shot and killed her teenaged daughter and son because they would not stop “mouthing off.” <br /><br /><br /><br />Violence has always been a part of our world’s landscape and living in the self-righteous, often squeeky clean, dreamscape we create for ourselves, it is difficult for us to imagine such things. Yet, there they are.<br /><br /><br /><br />I read with a sense of horror on the one hand and compassion on the other. I want to understand the killers so that I will somehow be able to make sense of their actions. On the other hand, I feel a sense of anger and a desire to seek on them retribution for the pain and suffering they cause.<br /><br /><br /><br />These are practice opportunities offered up by the real world. <br /><br /><br /><br />Are we actually one? Are human beings essentially the same? I suspect so, yet in this sameness, some might view the need to kill is, itself, an act of great religious merit, or an act of compassion itself. Maybe we might want to look at our differences again. Maybe compassion and tolerance need to be revisited. The killers and oppressors have in their hearts the desire to do the right thing, and fueled by hate and fear, it is not so much more difficult for them to feel justified in their behavior any more than it is not difficult for me to loathe them. <br /><br /><br /><br />Loving your enemies is likely the most challenging of religious precepts, is it not? <br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.<br /><br /></div>
