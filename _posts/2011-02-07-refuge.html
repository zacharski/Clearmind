<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With palms together,<br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br />Listening to the gas logs in the fireplace burn, I remind myself of the sound of real logs burning in the wood cook stove at the Refuge. The trouble with memories is that they take us away from this moment in time. On the other hand, perhaps this moment is a time for reflection in which case, memories are clearly appropriate. It is important to know the difference. <br /><br /><br /><br />Life without a past, is a life without a context. Life lived in the past is a life not being lived. <br /><br /><br /><br />Context has the potential to enrich our life experience or diminish it. Context is the Absolute aware of the Relative. Absolute, though, must give way to the Relativeâ€™s direct contact with what is. When we live in the world of the Absolute and all things are understood in terms of their true nature, we must also understand and accept the everyday, every-moment, relativity of things. Living in the Absolute without touching the Relative disallows the unique and wonderful nature of each being. <br /><br /><br /><br />On the other hand, living in the Relative world, we must not miss the fact that all things are without permanent form and exist in an intimate, but constantly changing, relationship with everything else. To miss this point is to suffer greatly. <br /><br /><br /><br />I no longer have a refuge in the mountains and the wood cook stove is no longer mine. While this is so, because it is so, it allows this precise moment to be experienced as it is, both richly and fully. <br /><br /><br /><br />Be well. <br /><br /></div>
