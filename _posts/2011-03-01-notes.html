<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With palms together,<br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br />Today at the Temple we will host Zen 101 at 6:00 PM, practice Zazen at 7:00 PM, and practice Yoga at 7:30 PM. <br /><br /><br /><br />After two months or so meeting at 3:00 PM for Yoga and rarely having anyone come, we have decided to move our yoga practice to 7:30 PM Monday through Thursday, following Zazen at 7:00. Each practice period will be approximately 30 minutes in duration. <br /><br /><br /><br />If anyone should wish to practice yoga, tâ€™ai chi chih, Zazen, or have a personal teaching interview at anytime in the day, please call me at 575-680-6680 for an appointment. <br /><br /><br /><br />Tai Chi Chih continues to meet at 6:00 PM on Wednesdays.<br /><br /><br /><br />Our Friday 4:00 Zen Group will continue to meet and is followed by Zazen at about 5:30 PM.<br /><br /><br /><br />Lastly, we will conduct Zazenkai this Saturday from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM. Please call or email your reservation. A small donation of $10.00 would be appreciated.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.<br /><br /></div>
