<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With palms together,<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Good Afternoon Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This morning we woke in good time, a few stretches (I wouldn’t call it yoga) a few reps of the dumbbells (I wouldn’t call it a weight workout) and a trip to the Temple to don the vestments, open the service, sit Zazen and then leave to join Rev. Gozen-sensei, my former disciple, as he gave Shukke Tokudo to one of his disciples, Rev. Kim Vajramanas Pries. After the festivities, we regrouped at the International Delights Deli for a wonderful lunch. Rev. Dai Shugyo completed the service in my stead at the Temple and Dharma Teacher Zen Shin offered a talk. Afterwards, Soku Shin and I took Suki for a walk in the desert, albeit, a short walk, as MY DOGS are tired and still sore. Now resting, I have some time to write to you. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The wars of the United States seem to keep increasing, all very legitimate I am given to understand, yet wars, none-the-less. I am wondering where our resolve to find peaceful solutions to conflict went. What? Oh, excuse me, you’re right, there was never any such resolve. Must be all in my mind, but I thought our president was elected to bring an end to this nonsense. I must be mistaken, as there seems no real end in sight and now we have joined with other nations to fight another war. <br /><br /><br /><br />Maybe I am just getting old, but frankly, this is such old news. Here's the deal, I will be conned no more. I was born shortly after the conclusion of World War Two. So, I just researched our war efforts since I was born. Since then, we have been involved in the Korean war, the Vietnam war, and the following “operations”: <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />1. Operation Urgent Fury-Grenada (1983) <br /><br /><br /><br />2. Operation Just Cause-Panama (1989) <br /><br /><br /><br />3. Operation Desert Storm-Iraq (January and February 1991) <br /><br /><br /><br />4. Operation Restore Hope-Somalia (1993) <br /><br /><br /><br />5. Operations in Europe-Bosnia (1990's) <br /><br /><br /><br />6. Operation Enduring Freedom-Afghanistan (2001-present) <br /><br /><br /><br />7. Operation Iraqi Freedom-Iraq (2003-present)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />And now, Libya. (for a very detailed and eye-opening index of US Military operations, see this link. I feel sad for us. We have been led to believe for so long that we are a peaceful, peace-loving nation, but the record speaks for itself. For me to consider us a peaceful nation at any time in the future, I will need to see evidence that we can actually live in peace. I think I will be dying long before that ever happens. Until then, let’s be peaceful and peace-loving individuals, communities, and even cities. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I will be resuming my Peace Witness Vigils on Monday and Friday mornings at the Veteran’s Park tomorrow. In addition, I believe I will begin again to sit for peace at the Federal Building in downtown Las Cruces on Wednesday afternoons at 4:00 PM. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Please consider joining me.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Be well, be peace.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
