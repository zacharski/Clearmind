<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With respect,<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Last night was a delight at Rev. Kankin's Sangha. We sat two periods, did walking meditation, and had tea as I delivered a Dharma Talk on the Essentials of Zazen practice. Before all this, though, we had a wonderful meal of Bobby's Wonderful Beans, salad, and bread. We stoppd for a snack at an El Paso Starbucks on the way home.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This morning we did desert sand hill repeats of about a tenth of a mile each. The grade was varying but about 6%. We first walked to the hill through a sandy road, then did four repeats (me) five repeats (Kathryn). We then hiked back to the car. All tolled we did 1.5 miles. Heart rates were maxed out on the last two repeats, I believe (I forgot to put on my HR monitor this morning). Earlier this morning I caught up on my weights by doing a shortened version of Tuesday's chest and back workout. I did do the Wednesday leg workout, though, of squats and calf raises. I also carted my forty pound dumbbells up the flight of stairs to the weight room. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />We are now on our way to the Temple for our private yoga class. Tai Chi Chih, Zazen, and yoga this evening beginning at 6:00 PM.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Sesshin begins at 7:00 PM this Friday!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Be well!.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
