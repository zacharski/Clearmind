<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With palms together<br /><br /><br />Good Evening Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br />Sometimes thing get away from me. Today I had an appointment with my attorney to discuss a will, power of attorney, and an advanced directive. Unfortunately, it was scheduled at the same time as several of my weekly Dokusan’s. My apologies to all. <br /><br /><br /><br />It is important to keep ahead of things. Dying is one of them. Not that I plan to expire anytime soon, but life is short and unpredictable, so being prepared is always a good idea. <br /><br /><br /><br />When I do die, I would like to make the library I have collected over the years the Order’s. I would like all items related to Zen and the practice of Zen to be in the hands of my able disciples and my Jiisha. This Order should not be dependent on my living. <br /><br /><br /><br />I am, however, 64 years old and have had some rather serious, life threatening traumas. There is only so long a bunny can hop. It was time to get things in order.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well,<br /><br /></div>
