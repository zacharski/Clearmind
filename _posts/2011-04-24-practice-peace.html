<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With palms together,<br /><br /><br />Good Afternoon Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />Peace and joy to the world. Would that it were so. Unfortunately, we are fighting on many, many fronts and there is great discord in the world at large. There is fighting in nearly every land and if not fighting, great suffering. Sometimes to consider this truth is enough to make a sane person crazy.<br /><br /><br /><br />We have this month: Hanamatsuri, Passover, and Easter. Each celebrates the hope of liberation. Yet, it is clear to me that this sort of thing is a person by person thing. Groups are so often discordant. Mass liberation is a delusional hope. <br /><br /><br /><br />So, rather than ask for, or to pray for, world peace, I will chose instead to practice peace. <br /><br /><br /><br />Homeless Kodo once said it’s all about practice. He said it’s about Zazen. If it is raining and the roof leaks, try to fix it, but if you cannot fix it, move to where there is no drip and practice Zazen. He said religion is not a concept, but a practice. <br /><br /><br /><br />So, we do not believe in world peace, we become world peace. How? Practice peace. <br /><br /><br /><br />Don’t know how to do that? Hint. Put your body speech and mind in neutral.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.<br /><br /></div>
