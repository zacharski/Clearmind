<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With palms together,<br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />We have been considering sangha of late and what sangha really means.&nbsp; It used to be that sangha&nbsp;was a group of monks who practiced together, lived together, and wondered together.&nbsp; That was some time ago.&nbsp; Through the centuries, though, and with the ascendancy of lay practice centers, sangha has widened to include nearly everyone and, in some cases, everything, in the universe.<br /><br />Many lay practice centers welcome people in off the street, visitors who are curious, who might want to learn, and yet, have little real sense or desire to join a sangha.&nbsp;Visitors and&nbsp;people who simply attend, are not sangha members.&nbsp;We, in the Order of Clear Mind Zen, have just completed our grandfathering period.&nbsp; From this point forward,&nbsp;sangha members&nbsp;will be&nbsp;those who have joined and, once accepted,&nbsp;become members of the sangha. &nbsp;I think it should be said, a sangha is a commitment to join a group and support that group.&nbsp; It is not about the individuals needs, but rather the group's needs.&nbsp; This is where we, in America, seem to have an issue, because we seem to be all about ourselves. The Buddha Way is not that way.<br /><br />Sangha today may not be place specific, but could be connected through the virtual reality of the Internet.&nbsp; I have students in far away places, most I have met in person, some I have not, yet in each and every case, I feel a commitment and connection to them.&nbsp; I am here for them; they are here for me,.&nbsp; In a very real sense, in this, then, there is no "them" or "me," there is just the "sangha." <br /><br />For those living in or near Las Cruces, NM, please consider visting us and at some point, joining our sangha.&nbsp; If you are not in the area, please consider talking to me personally over&nbsp;Skype video chat.&nbsp; Simply email my&nbsp;Jiisha, Soku Shin, and&nbsp;set a time.&nbsp;<br /><br />Be well.<br /></div>
