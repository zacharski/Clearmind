<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">The Order of Clear Mind Zen <br /><br /><br />Rules for the Zendo<br /><br /><br /><br />1.) Silence is thunder. Zen etiquette calls for a deep and abiding silence in the Zendo. The Zendo is a solemn practice hall. We enter it to do the work of enlightenment: freeing all beings from suffering through the practice of Zazen. <br /><br /><br /><br />2.) Please turn off your cell phone and do not use it in the Zendo.<br /><br /><br /><br />3.) It is customary to remove our shoes before entering the Zendo. Gassho, bow, and enter with the right foot. Walk in “shashu” (left hand in enclosed fist, right hand covering it, elbows extended horizontally) to a cushion, bow, and take your seat facing the interior of the Zendo. Place your hands in the “cosmic mudra” (left hand in right, thumbs lightly touching) and practice Zazen until you are given further instruction. <br /><br /><br /><br />4.) Please do not keep drinks or food at your Zabuton during Zazen periods. If you require water to take medicine, take the medicine before Zazen or by stepping out of the Zendo during kinhin.<br /><br /><br /><br />5.) When walking in the Zendo, please place your hands in “Shashu” and walk slowly. <br /><br /><br /><br />6.) Bells or claps of wooden clappers (hyoshigi or shaku) govern all movements. <br /><br /><br /><br />7.) Loose fitting clothing is best, dark colors are preferred. <br /><br /><br /><br />8.) When practicing seated meditation, please avoid movements of any sort. If you must adjust your posture do so very quietly and with care not to disturb others. Expect the Ino or the presiding priest will offer correction to both posture and excess movement during practice periods.<br /><br /><br /><br />9.) The priest is referred to as “Reverend,”and if appropriate, &nbsp;“Sensei,” (Teacher) or “Roshi” (Old Teacher).<br /><br /><br /><br />10.) During Tea Service and Teisho it is customary to sit with hands in the “cosmic mudra.” Please do not interrupt the officiating priest. A question and answer period will be announced.<br /><br /><br /><br />11.) You are NOT expected to chant, make vows, or recite anything you do not feel comfortable reciting, vowing or chanting. However, we strongly encourage this practice!<br /><br /><br /><br />12.) Bows. Bowing is an important practice. It teaches us humility and assists us in lessening the grip of self. “Gassho” refers to the placing of palms together as a lotus bud. This symbolizes the bringing of the active and the passive, the self and other, together in its original ‘non-dualistic’ existence. Bows are done from the hip. A deep bow is a profound demonstration of respect for both self and other. <br /><br /><br /><br />13.) Once seated during Oryoki please do not get up from your seat. <br /><br /><br /><br />14.) Dana (Charity) is practiced quietly and typically without request. If you should wish to make an offering, place your offering in the bowl provided. It is located on the foyer altar table. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
