<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With palms together,<br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br />Recently my practice as abbot and founder of this Order has become challenging, well, more challenging than is usual. We are experiencing a degree of growth that can be a challenge in and of itself. Yet, growth we expect. What I didn’t expect was being faced with such a need for volunteers to staff the Temple, lead groups, and do some of the background work that is essential to the Order itself.<br /><br /><br /><br />We currently have four groups a week: Comparative Religion, Zen 101, Women in Zen, and Zen Discussion. We are practicing Zazen Monday, Tuesday, Friday, and Sunday as formal Zen practice periods. We have two Zen in the Park periods and one Tai Chi Chih class. We are working with Sangha members Tamra and Shelley to bring formal Zen practice to Mesilla and are traveling to El Paso regularly to offer teaching at our Both Sides/No Sides Sangha there. I received a letter from the CYFD Superintendent asking to meet with us regarding bringing meditation to the J. Paul Taylor Juvenile Correction facility here in southern New Mexico. On top of this, our webmistress has asked to be relieved of her responsibilities in that area. We are going to T or C this morning to meet with her.<br /><br /><br /><br />Our Membership Committee is evolving into a Membership Council. This council will meet to approve membership applications. New applicants will have to go through a screening procedure to be approved as Members of our Order. All Members will be expected to honor their practice commitments.<br /><br /><br /><br />We need members who are serious, engaged and willing to assist. We have a need for individuals to volunteer to be present certain nights of the week to act as greeters and representatives of the Order. We also have a need for one additional member to become a part of the Membership Council. If you are willing to do this, please contact Rev. Dai Shugyo through our Order’s email address, clearmindzen@yahoo.com.<br /><br /><br /><br />Lastly, Soku Shin and I have decided we will host the “Gatherings” at the Temple instead of our home after Friday’s group. We will also host the once a month Sunday Gatherings there as well. <br /><br /><br /><br />Up-coming: Zazenkai on the first Saturday of June. I will have several of my paintings on display at the Southwestern Jewish Art&nbsp;Festival at Temple Beth El, June 12. Tickets are $20.00 and includes champagne, mimosas, and a variety of foods. Please consider coming to that event.<br /><br /><br /><br />May you each be a blessing and I look forward to seeing you soon.<br /><br /><br /><br />Yours, <br /><br />Daiho<br /><br /></div>
