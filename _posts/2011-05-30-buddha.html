<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With palms together,<br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br />A monk asks in all earnestness, “What is Buddha?” The Master answers, “Shit on a stick!”<br /><br /><br /><br />If you think about this, you will go down the path to delusion. So, be careful. Only in your mind is the smell, feel, or judgment regarding shit. <br /><br /><br /><br />This koan asks us to see how we set things up, make shiny things in our minds, and fail then to see them clearly. Buddha is often shiny and golden. He is often calm and serene. He is always clean and well polished. Yet this, then, is only a clean and shiny Buddha. And if the Buddha is covered in puss? Or being eaten by worms and maggots? This, then, is a worm and maggot eaten Buddha. Are they the same or different?<br /><br /><br /><br />What makes a Buddha Buddha? Is it the shine, the gold, the purity? Or do these exist in our mind as Buddha attributes? <br /><br /><br /><br />Perhaps rather than asking “What is Buddha?” We might better ask, “Where is Buddha?” As Buddha is a figment of our imagination and thus a defilement itself. <br /><br /><br /><br />Cut through thoughts like this and you will meet buddha.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.<br /><br /><br /><br />Tonight: Zazen at 7:00 PM, Comparative Religion at 7:30 PM.<br /><br /></div>
