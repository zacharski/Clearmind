<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With palms together,<br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br />This week many things are happening: We have scheduled a meeting with the Superintendent of J. Paul Taylor Juvenile Corrections Facility for tomorrow morning to discuss implementing a Meditation program there. We are looking forward to establishing this program and hope that it will change the minds and enhance the lives of those youth incarcerated there. We will also meet this week with Claude Anshin Thomas and his jisha, Kenshin, via Skype to discuss a series of workshops to be offered here in November. Disciple Shoji, in California, is meeting this week with the gatekeeper of the prison chaplaincy program at Folsom prison. Lastly, our Ambercare Hospice training program, Solace, is in its second month. We are coming close to having a need for someone to offer their skills at Program Development on behalf of the Order. I would like to see someone volunteer to interview members in order to gather information about service and program needs or possibilities. From my point of view, these areas should include, but not be limited to, practice with vulnerable populations such as those dying, those ill, homeless, poor, and survivors of violence, including veterans. What is yours?<br /><br /><br /><br />Our Comparative Religion Discussion Group was very well attended last night. We had two Muslim men and the daughter of one of them, attend as guest speakers. We also had three new guest participants. The discussion was far reaching and lively. It was wonderful to see members of such a rich faith tradition speak about their faith and its practices. We would like to seek out and invite members of each faith tradition we encounter along the way. If anyone knows a few Christians well versed in that tradition who might offer their understanding to us next Monday evening, please invite them and let us know if they accept.<br /><br /><br /><br />Tonight is Zen 101 at 6:00 PM. Please consider joining us for our discussion of the fifth Ox-Herding picture!<br /><br /><br /><br />Yours, Daiho<br /><br /></div>
