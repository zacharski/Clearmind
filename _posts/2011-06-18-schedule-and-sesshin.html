<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With palms together,<br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />I would like to change the schedule to make it more consistent across the week. Please consider 6:30 – 7:00 PM Monday through Friday for Zazen. Our Monday and Tuesday Groups would then meet at 7:00 PM, while the Women’s Group meets at 5:30 PM on Thursdays. It appears there is waning interest in the Friday Group. I therefore suggest we cancel it. <br /><br /><br /><br />So, our proposed schedule: <br /><br />Monday through Friday Zazen at 6:30 PM<br /><br />Comparative Religion Group Monday at 7:00 PM<br /><br />Zen 101 Tuesday at 7:00<br /><br />Women in Zen Thursday at 5:30.<br /><br /><br /><br />Lastly, regarding the implementation of a morning schedule. I would like to consider Monday through Friday Zazen at 9:30 AM. The Mesilla Sangha meets on Tuesday and Thursday, in Old Mesilla, at this time for Zazen. I suggest we replicate this at our Zendo on weekdays.<br /><br /><br /><br />Please offer some comments on this.<br /><br /><br /><br />July 8, 9, and 10 will be our Summer Sesshin. It will be held in our Zendo on Alameda. Please email me your reservation. We are limited to ten registration. Sesshin will begin at 7:00 PM on the 8th. And close at 12:00 PM on the 10th.<br /><br /><br /><br />Yours in the dharma,<br /><br />Daiho<br /><br /></div>
