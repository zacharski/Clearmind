<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Today I would like to ask you about our Sunday practice. It used to be that Sunday mornings were the times that the entire Sangha gathered together to sit. Out Temple has not coalesced in that way. Instead, we have people that come on Monday, some on Tuesday, others on Thursday, and a few on Friday. But a single day when all of us come together has not been happening. I am wondering why. Perhaps it is because we are meeting at 9:00 and 9:00 is too early? Perhaps if we moved the Sunday service to 10:00? Perhaps there are just too many things at the Temple and people need to select one or two? Maybe we should roll all of our educational groups into one Sunday morning curriculum and just have weekdays be for straight Zazen practice?<br /><br /><br /><br />Just a thought. Let me know yours,<br /><br /><br /><br />Daiho<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
