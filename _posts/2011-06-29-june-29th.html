<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br />With palms together,<br /><br />Good Afternoon Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />The Dharma is incomparably profound and minutely subtle…so, says the chant for opening a sutra. In fact, the Dharma is as plain as the nose on our face. It is the nose on your face. My face. Every face. No face. Because it is everywhere, it is nowhere. As one of the Ten Ox-Herding pictures suggests, “no thing.” <br /><br /><br /><br />If it is nothing and it is everything, what is it?<br /><br /><br /><br />We cannot say, because as we speak, falsehood flows from our mouths. One and all, all and one, yet both and neither. Goodness…we can certainly get a headache with this sort of stuff. <br /><br /><br /><br />What difference does this Zennish nonsense make? Not much. The Dharma for me is the feel of the pc keys under my fingertips, the heat of the southwestern sun, the sweat dripping from my forehead as I work, or the taste of cold water as I take a sip from my glass. Everything in every direction manifests the Dharma. The flowing stream, once entered, is ours knowing in fact, there is no stream and that “the stream” itself is just a construct we use to assist us in getting in the flow. <br /><br /><br /><br />So? Just sip some water.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.<br /><br /></div>
