With palms together,<br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />The Order of Clear Mind Zen will retreat into Summer Sesshin from today at 7:00 PM through Sunday at 4:00 PM. We will be joined by members of the Zen Center of Las Cruces and the Both Sides/No Sides Zen Sangha in El Paso. <br /><br /><br /><br />May you each practice to be awake and thoroughly present in this moment.<br /><br /><br /><br />Yours,<br /><br />Daiho
