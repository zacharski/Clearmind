With palms together,<br /><br />Good Evening Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br />Our Summer Sesshin was very good, if not quite challenging for those who had to bear the sound of me with a nasty cold. I could barely speak and was in considerable distress, but sesshin is a potent and important cornerstone to our practice. We had several members of the Zen Center of Las Cruces participate, as well as three people from our El Paso Sangha. It was a packed Zendo. <br /><br /><br /><br />Tenzo Tamra was superb in her practice. Meals were delicious and served properly: all meals were Oryoki style with our three bowl Oryoki sets. Jisha Soku Shin was our Zendo Jikido who provided supervision in the Zendo. Steve was our Doan who kept the time for Zazen and Kinhin. Rev. Dai Shugyo, our Ino, kept things going even in the midst of confusion which was, thanks to all, kept to a minimum. I was very thankful for the support of Rev. Gozen-sensei, abbot of the Zen Center of Las Cruces, for his willingness to co-officiate this event with me. I am also thankful for Rev. Kankin’s special effort to come Saturday morning from El Paso even though he has spent considerable time on the road over the last several weeks. In passing we had a cordial visit from Ken-roshi and his teacher An Gaio who is visiting from California. Fortunately, they arrived during a period where we could offer iced tea and a short tour of our Temple.<br /><br /><br /><br />Rev. Gozen offered a lovely teisho opening night, we held an Abbot’s Dialogue at Saturday Morning services, and I offered a teisho regarding Matsuoka-roshi this morning. Tenzo Tamra lead a Study period on Master Dogen’s Instructions to the Zen Cook. Our sitting periods were extensive and strong and mindful silence was maintained most of the time.<br /><br /><br /><br />This week we begin Peace Camp for three weeks in a row. Also we will begin our work in the youth correctional facility here in southern, New Mexico. As a reminder, Monday through Friday we practice at 9:30 AM, again at 6:00 PM. We host a Comparative Religions Discussion Group on Monday evening at 7:00, an Introduction to Zen Group on Tuesday at 7:00 PM, and a Women in Zen Group on Thursday at 7:00 PM. Please consider joining us for any of these practice opportunities. <br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
