With palms together,<br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br />From the outside looking in:<br /><br /><br /><br />If we spend our day in silent illumination it is possible to begin to see every breath as life itself. Our breath is our life. Breathing in, we allow the universe to enter us; breathing out, we enter it. And in time, we discern there is no inner or outer and that flow is actually just present moment awareness. Then, there is no breathing.<br /><br /><br /><br />Wave actualizes water. Two depends on one.<br /><br /><br /><br />From the inside looking out:<br /><br /><br /><br />We notice we are born in every breath, a birth that separates us one from another. Over and over we ask ourselves “who is this” which notices anything at all? And what does “notice” imply? The moment “we” notice, we create a division: this notices that. I am breathing.<br /><br /><br /><br />Water notices wave. One depends on two.<br /><br /><br /><br />“What are the teachings?” Master Dogen asks, the elder Tenzo replies, “One, two, three, four, five.”<br /><br /><br /><br />Everything is both separate and not separate simultaneously. Thing and no-thing simultaneously. Through our breath we manifest both our individual and universal realities.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relationship is everything.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
