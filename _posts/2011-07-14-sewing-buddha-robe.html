With respect,<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Those interested in attending a rakusu sewing group for Jukai Ceremony, please reply to me via telephone or email. Soku Shin has volunteered to lead this group. Our first meeting will be Tuesday evening at 6:00 PM before Zen 101. We will then do a closing service and practice period afterwards. The sewing group is open to any who wishes to learn about the Buddha's robe and how one is made.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.
