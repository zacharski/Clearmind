With palms together,<br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />We conclude this week with Peace Camp at 8:30 AM, Morning Services at 9:30 AM, and Evening Services at 6:00 PM. It has been a full week with Peace Camp each morning back to back with our Morning Service, and on Thursday, our effort to bring Zen to the youth at the Southern New Mexico Juvenile Corrections Facility. Soku Shin co-led Peace Camp, Student Steve assisted with the Corrections Facility, and we are now looking at a day of rest on Saturday.<br /><br /><br /><br />Sunday we will offer our weekly Zen Service with Tea Service and Teisho. We will follow this with a discussion of our recent Sesshin. We will provide coffee, tea, and muffins for this discussionâ€™s refreshments. <br /><br /><br /><br />We have ordered two copies of the Heart of Being and two copies of the Eight Gates of Zen, texts used in our two discussion groups. The order was delivered somewhere yesterday, just not to us. Amazon has shipped overnight another order. It is supposed to arrive today. We will see.<br /><br /><br /><br />Lastly, we will offer a Zazenkai Saturday, August 6th from 9:00 AM through 4:00 PM. This is a day long meditation retreat with the contemplative eating practice of Oryoki featured at lunch. Please consider joining us. Email me your reservation. Our suggested donation fee is $15.00. <br /><br /><br /><br />I hope to see you soon.<br /><br /><br /><br />Yours, <br /><br />Daiho
