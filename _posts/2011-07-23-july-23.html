<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div closure_uid_8h1o29="109">With palms together,</div><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br />This morning we woke late as we were up into the night. Our wagessa group did well, although there was a degree of nervousness being reported regarding the actual process of sewing. This is an area where Zen practice is extremely helpful. Just a stitch. Just a breath. Nothing more. Our practice is to stay in the stitch and the breath and let all of the rest go. Practice. <br /><br /><br /><br />Once the wagessas are completed, we will take them to a shop and have the embroidery applied. <br /><br /><br /><br />Then, when the student is ready, as determined by the Teacher, we will conduct a ceremony and the person will take The Three Treasures and the Pure Precepts as their own.<br /><br /><br /><br />What comes after is all about one’s willingness to manifest one’s true nature. <br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.<br /><br /></div>
