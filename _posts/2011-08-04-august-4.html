<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div closure_uid_vxs8gq="110">With palms together,</div><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />Yesterday afternoon we had a surprise call and delivery of furnishings from my former teacher's Dharma Mountain Zendo in Cloudcroft. He has retired and has dismantled his Zendo. We now have elevated tans along each wall. We had to remove one of the partitions in order to accomodate these beautiful and classic Zendo furnishings. We also received a chest of drawers used to keep incense and other ceremonial objects. We will spend the next two days getting the Zendo back into shape from everything being moved around in order to be ready for Zazenkai on Saturday. My thanks to Ino Dai Shugyo, Jiisha Soku Shin, Tenzo Tamra, Sangha Member Marcos, ZCLC Members GoZen and Pierre, and friend Artie who helped move everything, tear down the partition, and otherwise assisted in this unexpected process. <br /><br /><br /><br />We have one remaining seat available for Zazenkai. If you are interested in attending and practicing with us this coming Saturday from 9:00 to 4:00 PM, please email me as soon as possible. <br /><br /><br /><br />Today at CMZT: Zazen at 9:30 AM and again at 6:00 PM; UN Peace Day Celebration Planning Meeting at Unity Church at 1:00 PM, and dokusan at 2:30 PM.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.<br /><br /></div>
