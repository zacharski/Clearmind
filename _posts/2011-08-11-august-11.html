<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br />With palms together,<br /><br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br />Today at Clear Mind Zen Temple we will sit Zazen at 9:30 and again at 6:00 PM. Soku Shin will lead our Sewing Group at 5:00 PM. If you are sewing a rakusu or wagessa, or want to, please consider joining her.<br /><br /><br /><br />Sewing the Buddha’s robe is a deep, contemplative practice. The Buddha’s robe is a manifestation of morality. It is done slowly and with great reverence. With each stitch is offered a reminder that we are one with the buddha, awake, and deeply practicing to end all suffering. So, it is your effort to bring morality into the universe. It is a manifestation of your true nature. <br /><br /><br /><br />The original robes were made from cloth coverings of bodies in charnel grounds. These rags were washed and dyed, cut into strips, and sewn in the pattern we have today. Each member of the Buddha’s Order received three robes. These, along with a begging bowl, were pretty much a monk’s sole possessions. To become a follower of the Buddha Way at that time meant a complete renunciation not only of family life, possessions, etc., but also of self. It was thought that when we renounced self, our true nature would be unimpeded.<br /><br /><br /><br />This is a tradition that cuts across most religions. Abraham “went forth” left what he knew, as did Moses and the Israelites. Jesus went out into the desert, leaving what he knew, and in this home-leaving spiritual seekers freed himself from the bonds of “knowing” and was thus in a place where his cup was empty and he could be taught.<br /><br /><br /><br />Today, we do something similar. We enter a Zendo leaving what we know at the door. We raise the Buddha’s robe to our head and recite a brief chant. We open the robe and wrap ourselves in it. This is followed by our verse of atonement which both reminds us of the fact that we create the conditions that create harm, resolve to cease doing this, and invoke non-duality once again. From here we receive the Three Treasures: we take refuge in being awake, live in the real world, and support harmonious community interaction. <br /><br /><br /><br />Our day begins with the robe of benefaction, a reminder for us that we are here for the sake of others. It is up to us to have the courage to take the next step.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.<br /><br /></div>
