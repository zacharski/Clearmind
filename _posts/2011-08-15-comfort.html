<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div closure_uid_1crui1="109">realization, just as Dogen understood Zazen. If we are uncomfortable, it is important to face that discomfort not step away from it. </div><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Here are a set of truths: Spiritual practice is a discipline. Every discipline is uncomfortable. Comfort is awakeningâ€™s enemy. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The Order of Clear Mind Zen is fairly simple with straightforward practices. Few frills. We offer Sangha membership, Zazen, and study groups. You may use a chair after it is determined that you cannot sit on a cushion or use a bench. If you cannot sit still we will invite you to practice harder. Our building is air conditioned and we do not have access to the thermostat. We have a small fan and use it when the Zendo is full. All of this, though, is window dressing. When you come to a Zen Center you are coming to practice Zazen. It is a practice that can be challenging. This is where the commitment to a disciplined practice comes in. The Buddha referred to this as the development of kashanti, (patience or forbearance) a word we rarely use today (I wonder why?!)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The thing is that without kashanti we become weak. Dependent on ease, we never really face ourselves. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.<br /><br /></div>
