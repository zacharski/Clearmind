<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With palms together,<br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />An certain Owen Flanagan, PhD recently blogged on Huffington Post that “Buddhism is first and foremost a complex philosophy about the nature of reality, the self and morality.” He goes on to suggest that we American Buddhists use a “code” for meditation by which he means to say, we actually practice the Buddha Way. Dr. Flanagan is right. But his thesis (that we are bourgeois Buddhists and know little to nothing of “Buddhism” is far from the mark as he completely misunderstands and mis-states the Buddha Way. <br /><br /><br /><br />As anyone passing familiar with what we call “Buddhism” will tell us, there is actually no such thing as “Buddhism.” There are a set of practices taught by the Buddha, passed down through the millennia, refined and honed. The derived teachings from such practice when written about becomes something to test in our own practice, but philosophy? I do not believe so. It is only through a Western, academic eye, such might be the case. Buddhism is the Buddha Way, no -ism, thank you very much.<br /><br /><br /><br />In countries Dr. Flanagan speaks of, where he claims Buddhists do not meditate is only half correct, Buddhists in Tibet, Nepal, Korea, Japan, etc., do meditate. But this notwithstanding, he takes the wrong point. In such places the Buddha Way has become much like that of Christianity here in the United States. Sunday Christians sing hosannas in Church and flick drivers off on the way home. Maybe they have actually read the Sermon on the Mount, but to literally practice the wisdom teaching of Jesus? Not. <br /><br /><br /><br />American Zen Buddhism is all about the actual practice of the Buddha Way. The Buddha Way is Zazen. This is what the Buddha taught and this is what true, authentic Buddhists do. So, in contradistinction to the dismissive nature of Dr. Flanagan comments regarding Buddhism in America, the wonderful thing about the Buddha Way as practiced in the United States is that we are actually doing the practice. We have taken Master Dogen seriously, as well as all the Buddhas and Patriarchs before and after him. We practice to study the Buddha Way, thus practice to study the self, and sooner or later, through our practice, allow the mind and body to fall away. <br /><br /><br /><br />This practice, this Buddha Way, has nothing to do with a goal. Nor does it have anything to do with happiness or heart rates. In America we are witnessing the rise of a new, true Buddhism, the same Buddhism Master Dogen found in China and brought back to Japan. It is there for each of us. <br /><br /><br /><br />Be well. <br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
