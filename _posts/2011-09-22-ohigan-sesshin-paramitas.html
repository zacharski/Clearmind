<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br />With palms together,<br /><br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br />We are getting very excited about our coming sesshin and Seniors gathering day. We have people from California and Texas, as well as Guest Teacher Rev. Taiun Elliston-sensei, coming. Thursday will be a workshop day led by Rev. Elliston and myself. We are hoping to have an open discussion about Soto Zen, our lineage, and opportunities to deepen our practice. <br /><br /><br /><br />Beginning Friday evening we will enter Ohigan Sesshin and close that on Sunday afternoon. Ohigan, as you may know, is the sesshin done in honor of crossing over to the other shore, realizing we have never left. We prepare by beginning to examine the Six Paramitas. The paramitas, generosity, morality, patience, vigor, meditation, and wisdom, are aspects of our Buddha Nature, so to speak. They are the actualization of our True Nature. The thing is, these aspects, like all dharmas, are constantly changing. They are interdependent and interconnected. Therefore, we say they are empty. <br /><br /><br /><br />Generosity in this moment will manifest as this moment requires. It is not a constant, static thing, and cannot be defined in this way. We often say dana paramitas is “giving” but this is misleading. Giving requires a giver, a gift, and a receiver. Dana is more like a flow. Do not consider what is flowing or from whence or to where the flow is moving. Just flow. <br /><br /><br /><br />Practice where we lift the focus from the “I” to the universe allows us the possibility of realizing unification and actualizing it. Releasing thought of “I am meditating” or the thought of “I am patient,” creates an opportunity to just be meditation or patience. So, paramita practice is about releasing oneself, or more directly, getting out of our own way, so that what quite naturally resides in us is actualized. <br /><br /><br /><br />Our sesshin is closed as we have now maxed out, but the Sunday morning service will remain open to the public and it will begin at 10:00 AM. Please consider joining us. <br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.<br /><br /><br /><br />For those attending sesshin, a few notes from my Jiisha:<br /><br /><br /><br />SESSHIN IS A SILENT MEDITATION RETREAT TO BENEFIT OUR PRACTICE:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />SILENT means No Talking. If we are talking, we are likely not practicing. Please monitor yourself. Reminders will be provided as needed.<br /><br /><br /><br />Sesshin is a silent MEDITATION retreat to benefit our practice: <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />MEDITATION means zazen, kinhin, oryoki and samu, primarily. This is an opportunity for us to spend an extended period of time engaged in these activities exclusively.<br /><br />Use your time well, there is nothing else to “do.”<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Sesshin is a silent meditation retreat to benefit our PRACTICE:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />PRACTICE means the way in which we manifest the dharma in each moment. <br /><br />Since we are celebrating Ohigan--Consider the Paramitas in this regard, and consider the vows you have taken, or may be studying.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Let’s come together to make this sesshin a time that will enhance not only our personal study and practice, but that of the sangha, the Order, and the universe itself<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />NECESSITIES LIST--for Sesshin Participants<br /><br />SLEEPING GEAR—please note that the floor at the zendo is<br /><br />wood, and the floor at our residence is Pergo (no carpeting)<br /><br />-Air mattress and pump, pillow, sleeping bag or sheet/blanket<br /><br />-Pajamas (full-coverage, please)<br /><br />-Towel/Wash Cloths (shower at zendo, bathtub at residence)<br /><br />-Toiletries, minimal (no electrical devices, please)<br /><br />-Medications<br /><br />-Flashlight (mandatory)<br /><br />CLOTHING and FOOTWEAR:<br /><br />-Change of clothing for as many days as you will be with us.<br /><br />Remember that sesshin involves samu, which is often rigorous.<br /><br />-Clothing must be clean each day, dark in color (preferably black), loose fitting, comfortable, and full-coverage (no tank tops, “camis” shorts, etc).<br /><br /><br /><br />-Kinhin will be performed outside. Please bring slip-on shoes to the zendo that are easy to put on as you will be moving in and out of the temple in a single file line. <br /><br /><br /><br />PLEASE NOTE:<br /><br /><br /><br />You will have “free time” during sesshin. Please use this time to take care of your personal needs and to continue your practice. Free time is NOT social time. In fact, there is no social time during sesshin. <br /><br />Please do not bring books, writing materials, computers, cell phones,<br /><br />or equivalent electronic devices into the zendo or residence. If there is <br /><br />some sort of URGENT communication you must have during sesshin,<br /><br />please speak to Rev. Daiho to arrange for this now.<br /><br /></div>
