<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br />With palms together,<br /><br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br />Joshu asked, “What is the path?” Nansen said, “Everyday life is the path.” Later Nansen added, “If you want to reach the true path beyond doubt, place yourself within the same freedom as that of the sky…”<br /><br /><br /><br />There are two aspects that arise from disciplined practice. First, our disciplined practice is in every moment. Second, as a result, our disciplined practice is not contained by the dimensions of a zabuton. As Janis Joplin sang, “Freedom’s just another word for nothing left to lose.” In Zen we actually mean this. <br /><br /><br /><br />When every moment is practice it means in every moment we are attuned to our heart/mind. There is just this in front of us and there is no separation between it and us. Why? Because we realize there is no “it” and no “us.” When ownership, attachment, and emotional investment fall away there is nothing left to lose, but nothing has been lost either. In fact, we have actually gained the universe itself. <br /><br />We speak of a “path” as if to say there is an actual journey, a beginning point, a walking along the way point, and an end point. This is deluded thinking. Better would be to forget the word “path” altogether. Throw “journey” away, as well. As our true nature is within us and everything else, where is there to go? <br /><br />A boundless sky has room for the birds, the trees, and the earth. A boundless sky, by its nature, allows a frame. Yet, in truth, the frame and the sky are one. When properly understood, neither are independent, both inter-are.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.<br /><br /></div>
