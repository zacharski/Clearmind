<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br />With palms together,<br /><br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br />With every breath we have an opportunity to practice from our heart. In our everyday life, the lives most of us lead, we are surrounded by others, receive sensory data from every sense organ, and in Zen, are asked to learn to release ourselves in each moment. A Zen life, therefore, is a very challenging life.<br /><br />To help us, we might establish a home practice. This practice might include a period of Zazen, incense, candles, and bells, but it might also include a liturgy such as the Three Refuges and the Heart Sutra. In addition, home practice might include chanting a meal blessing, a blessing when rising, a blessing when going to bed. The point is not the blessings, the point is to draw us into every moment practice. Below are three verses to possibly use. There are many. <br /><br />A home altar may be useful in establishing a space for your contemplative practice. A small statue, a candle, a water offering, an incense burner, and something beautiful like a flower or plant, sets the stage. Of course if you do not want a statue, that is fine. Perhaps an inspiring picture will do.<br /><br />Set a time for your practice and stick to it. Also set a length of time to be on your seat. The length of time is not as important as the fact that you come to your seat regularly and with discipline. <br /><br />At our Temple we have a few copies of Taiun Elliston-sensei’s Home Liturgy book for $10.00 each. There is also available through Amazon, John Daido Loori’s “Bringing the Sacred to Life: The Daily Practice of Zen Ritual.” These texts offer hints and suggestions to help you with your home practice. Of course, if you have any questions, please feel free to email me or ask me in person. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Morning Verse<br /><br />This morning I vow with all beings<br /><br />To see the world clearly<br /><br />As it is, to end violence,<br /><br />And bring compassion to all beings.<br /><br /><br /><br />Evening Verse<br /><br />This evening, as I go to sleep,<br /><br />May all beings rest deeply<br /><br />And be renewed in peace and love.<br /><br />Meal Gatha<br /><br />We reflect on the effort that brought us this food---<br /><br />And consider how it comes to us.<br /><br />We reflect on our virtue and practice---<br /><br />And consider whether we are worthy of this offering.<br /><br />We regard greed as an obstacle to freedom of mind.<br /><br />We regard this meal as medicine to sustain our life.<br /><br />For the sake of Enlightenment we now receive this food.<br /><br />Verse for Shaving the Head<br /><br />We shave the head <br /><br />That we may see<br /><br />How by freeing ourselves from attachments<br /><br />We are released from suffering.<br /><br />Be well <br /><br /></div>
