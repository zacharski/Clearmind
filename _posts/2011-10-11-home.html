<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br />With palms together,<br /><br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br />Rev. Soku Shin and I have returned from a rather spontaneous camping trip to the Grand Canyon National Park. We traveled with both Suki and Binky, a two person tent, two sleeping bags, a two burner campstove, and an air mattress. Of course we also brought along toiletries, food, and clothing.<br /><br />The entire trip was wonderful. The canyon is clearly both a national and international treasure. We heard a cacophony of voices on the rim. Camping was a delight. I was able to get campfires going, cooked pancakes and eggs, grilled cheese sandwiches, and even spaghetti and spaghetti sauce. On the drive home we visited both El Morro and the Bosque Del Apache. Soku Shin had an opportunity to see the land where I had worked with Navajo and Zuni. I had an opportunity to experience her outright joy. <br /><br />We are happy to hear that services on Sunday went well. Thank you Rev. Dai Shugyo and Rev. Kobusshin. <br /><br />Today at Clear Mind Zen Temple: Zazen at 9:30 AM, Zazen at 6:00 PM and Zen 101 at 7:00 PM. Rev Mumun of the Deming Zen Center will be our invited teacher. He will address Korean Zen and Koan Study.<br /><br />Be well.<br /><br /></div>
