<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br />With palms together,<br /><br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br />This morning brings a visit to my neurologist who will give me results of the imaging series I had a few weeks ago. As a result of the cardiac testing, I had a sneak peak which revealed no significant brain change and some arterial build-up in the carotid arteries. The build-up is not significant, they say. We will see what neurology has to say and the heart catheterization I will undergo Tuesday of this week. So, Tuesday’s Temple activities will be postponed until next week when we will tackle the first section of the Bendowa. <br /><br /><br /><br />We will practice Zazen at 9:30 AM. I should be able to get to Temple in time, assuming my neurologist is not too awfully talkative. Also, this Saturday is Zazenkai. Rev. Soku Shin and I will practice from 9:00 AM until 4:00 PM. If you wish to join us, please email me ASAP as our Tenzo assistant, Shelley Tenborin will need a count.<br /><br /><br /><br />Last night’s guest teacher presentation by Rev. Mumun was excellent. He told us of Zen Master Seung Sahn, his lineage’s history, and did a wonderful job presenting koan work as exemplified in the Korean Zen tradition of his lineage’ founder. It was very good to hear the stories I often tell coming from a different perspective. I am reminded that we should not be wedded to views.<br /><br /><br /><br />It is time now for us to walk the dogs, Suki and Binky, and then visit the medical world. I will be happy to sit on the cushion this morning afterwards. <br /><br /><br /><br />Be well. <br /><br /></div>
