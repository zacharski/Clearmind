<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I think Occupy wall Street has it all wrong. Better: Occupy Your Wallet --- Don't buy pre-packaged foods, don't buy a new car, don't buy a house, don't get a loan. Give up credit cards. Try riding a bike. Try eating fresh foods. Try not surrounding yourself with so much stuff that it takes hours to clean and several thick-necked men to load on a truck to move. We are the problem, so we can be the solution.<br /><br />Now, to follow my own advice!<br /><br /><br /></div>
