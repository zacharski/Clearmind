<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With palms together,<br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br />This week will be a slow and careful experience of medicine. Tomorrow I undergo a cardiac catheterization and will, hopefully, experience a repair of whatever is wrong with my heart, if anything. The results will tell me if I need a valve replaced or not. I go to the cath lab at Memorial Medical Center at 7:00 AM and will have the procedure at 11:00 AM. If nothing is corrected, I will be out by nightfall. If something is repaired, they say they will keep me a day. All bets are off. So, I think it is best if I cancel my involvement at the Temple this week, including dokusan. My apologies to each of you. <br /><br /><br /><br />May you each be a blessing in the universe.<br /><br />Yours, <br /><br />Daiho<br /><br /></div>
