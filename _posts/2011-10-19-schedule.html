<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With respect, <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Zazen for sangha members will be offered at 9:30 this morning. We will continue our schedule as posted. For those in the Zen 101 class, we will begin our study of The Wholehearted Way in earnest on Tuesday. We are still working our way through the smushed-up schedule that occured as a result of Taiun-sensei's visit. We will hold our November Zazenkai on November, 5. Our Rohatsu Sesshin will be an expanded version beginning on the 6th and concluding on the 11th. You have the ability to select the first three days, the last three days, or the entire six days. We are fixing the fee at $15.00 per day for all intensives. We are limiting our zazenkai and sesshin to 12 persons. Priority will be given to those registering for the entire six days. Lastly, we are asking that people register for intensives and pay in advance. This helps us fund the Tenzo and purchase necessary supplies. We will have registration forms available at the Temple. If you are out of town and wish to register, please email me and I will post a form to you.<br /><br /><br /><br />We look forward to concluding our year in earnest practice with you.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well,<br /><br /></div>
