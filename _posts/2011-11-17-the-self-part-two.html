<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The Self, part two,<br /><br /><br /><br />Discussions of “the self” lead us too often in the wrong direction, the direction of the individual, as if the individual actually exists. When we practice deeply we can see that individuals are actually not individuals, but are rather aggregates of a deeply interconnected and interdependent whole. Care must be taken here, however, as even this is misleading: when we reside in the “whole” or “Universal,” the “Universal” itself is rendered meaningless. <br /><br /><br /><br />One aim of practice, then, is to penetrate this. This is the place of “mind and body fall away.” With no mind and no body, there is no individual, but no universal either. Relative and absolute depend on each other, just as black needs white to render meaning to itself.<br /><br /><br /><br />So, when we address “self” we should look outward from our individualistic view and attempt to see the vast, living web of complete existence. This is the true self, the self without a name, the self that existed before our fathers and mothers were born, the self that never is born and never dies. This is everything that is, was, and will be. This is also everything that is nothing. This is no-self, no thingness manifest.<br /><br /><br /><br />The self makes itself in relation to all other things. It is interactive, seamless and completely dynamic. Without other, there is no self. Without self, there is no other. This is to say, I am the manifestation of all there is, was, and will be. As are you. <br /><br /><br /><br />So here we are, arising out of nothingness. We are not complete, however, until we make ourselves manifestations of the whole. <br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.<br /><br /></div>
