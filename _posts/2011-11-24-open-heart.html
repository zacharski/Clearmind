<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The season is upon us. A season of introspection and manifestation of good will. Every year I hope this season’s underlying feeling will spread out like a warm and loving pool supporting each of us with compassion and generosity through the year. My sense is this is exactly what is happening, although sometimes the subtle nature of the pool is difficult to see. Let’s endeavor to bring our heart out into the open not only this year, but the next, and the next after that. <br /><br />Be well.<br /><br /></div>
