<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I shave my head that I may<br /><br /><br />See how by freeing<br /><br />Myself from attachments<br /><br />I am released from suffering.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Thus I begin this morning's activity at 4:00 AM. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Next is washing my face, then brushing my teeth, then putting on my robe, then taking my seat in the Zendo. Of course there are a variety of other chants and practices done before, during, and after each of these, but in the main, mine is a simple, straightforward life of coming to attention.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This is Rohatsu and I take it very seriously. It is the culmination of my year of practice and I dedicate myself to doing it with great diligence. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />In our tradition, we just sit. But this "just sitting" is not at all about simply folding one's legs and facing a wall. It is far more than that. Just sitting is all encompasing, pervasive, and foundational Buddha Nature made manifest through our relentless activity of just sitting. It is, as Master Dogen refers to it, jijuyu zanmai, the self creating and living out the self wholeheartedly in everyday life. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Rohatsu points to this king of samadhis and demands our complete and total attention as the pinnicle of our year as monks. Just as the Buddha sat relentlessly under the tree 2600 years ago, so we sit in the zendo relentlessly today. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Now, with a clean head, clean body, clean teeth, may I sit with a clean heart to bring the Buddha Dharma into the world. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />With palms together,<br /><br /><br /><br />A bow to each of you.<br /><br /></div>
