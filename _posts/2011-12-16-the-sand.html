<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Good Morning Y'all, <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />It is 0'Dark-Thirty here in New Mexico and we are awake sipping coffee and reading the news. I see that our Senate passed legislation allowing the US Military to arrest and indefinately detain US citizens without trial. Is it time to pull our heads out of ther friggin' sand yet? <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I wrote a letter to our President and to my senator for all the good it will do. There is just something wrong with this legislatiuon and the irony is it was signed on the annual celebration of the signing of the Bill of Rights to our Constitution. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Here's the thing, suppose we gave another war. Suppose we are in severe economoc hardship. Lots of people out of work with little real hope. Suppose we have a population who cannot read much more than the instructions on how to operate a video game or turn on a big screen TV and who is mesmerized by the fundies in Black &amp; White Churches who support capitalism to the brink. But their congregants can no longer afford to shop even at Wal-Mart. Now, suppose there are a few of us who really are unhappy with having another war. So we demonstrate at military bases, in front of federal buildings, etc. Now suppose Fox News decides to call us terrorists. In dark times without the benefit of civil rights protections seriously bad things can happen. It doesn't take long for fear to whip things into motion and out of control. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I fear for us as our world begins to crumble and governments respond by strengthening the powers of the military. It is exactly the wrong way to go. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Please write to president Obama and ask him not to sign this legislation.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Yours, <br /><br /></div>
