<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Good Morning All, <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Last night was an exercise in practice. I had been working on a new painting and almost had it when I just could not go onâ€¦ Kathryn and I did what we do and finally went to bed. All of a sudden at 2:30 AM, Suki and Binky were jumping up and down wanting desperately to go out. So, out we went. Cold and wet and dark they were in 7th Puppy Heaven. I, on the other hand, was in the Hell Realms.<br /><br /><br /><br />After they did what they do, we came in and slipped into the studio where my work was waiting. A stroke here, a stroke there and the painting was painting itself. Meanwhile Suki and Binky were sound asleep on the sofa. So it goes.<br /><br /><br /><br />At 7:30 we are now up, it is late, I finished the painting, am sipping my coffee, and am about to take the Pups out for a walk before going to the Zendo. Such is life. Hell and Heaven are simply the names we give to the relationships before us. When opposed to it: hell. When entering it: heaven. May we all practice the unification rag.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well. <br /><br /></div>
