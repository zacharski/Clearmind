<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br />Good Morning All, <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This morning I would like to talk about the coming year. I have posted the retreat schedule on the Clear Mind Zen website. We have made some adjustments to our retreat schedules to accommodate to our Sanghaâ€™s needs. All of our intensives will begin at 8:00 AM and close at 5:00 PM. These will be either one day or five day retreats and oryoki lunch is included. We will ask for $15.00 per day as a donation to assist us in covering our expenses and we ask that these be offered in advance. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Private interviews are to be conducted either at my residence or at the Zendo. My Jiisha, Rev. Soku Shin will be responsible for scheduling private interviews with me. Her email address is kathrynmasaryk@yahoo.com. Dana to the teacher is part of our practice of generosity and is greatly appreciated. A bowl is provided. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />As this year unfolds I will be focusing much of my attention on my own engaged practice. I have asked Rev. Dai Shugyo to help create a file of practice opportunities, contact information, and so forth for your reference so that you each might find something to do to help make a difference in the world. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I will likely be writing much less as my art seems to be eclipsing writing as my voice. Although I do expect to write some fiction or plays and perhaps some poetry, I will leave most of my teaching to my time in the Zendo and in private interviews. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Lastly, I want to thank each and every one of you for your practice and continued support of our small Sangha. 2012 will be my 65th year alive and I very much look forward to living it as fully with you as possible. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Our practice is our foundation. Let us maintain it, treasure it, and nurture it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
