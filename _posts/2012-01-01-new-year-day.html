<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Happy New Year to each of you! I hope your year to come is filled with joy, peace, and wonder. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Kathryn and I will be at the Cafe de Mesilla from 12 to 2 today having coffee, eating pastries, and enjoying the plaza in Mesilla. I might even bring a drawing pad, charcoal, pen &amp; ink! Please consider dropping by. If we are out on the plaza, call or text me at 680-6680. <br /><br /><br /><br />Rev. Tamra Kobusshin will be leading a New Year's Day service in the Zendo from 4 to 6 this afternoon. Please consider joining her!<br /><br /></div>
