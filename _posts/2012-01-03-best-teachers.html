<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br />With respect,<br /><br /><br /><br />Good Morning All, <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Last night I was working with Rev. Kankin over Skype. We are working our way through the Genjokoan by Master Dogen, actually using the text as a springboard to discussing immediate issues in our lives as priests. We came upon the line in the commentary by Okumura-roshi that says, “So, in a sense, our delusions, our view that we are separate from the universal reality and our desire to change, is very important because it is a motivating force in our lives that enables us to practice.”<br /><br /><br /><br />This is very, very important to remember as we face each day. Our feelings about ourselves, our challenges and issues, are all teachers inviting us to learn something about ourselves and the universe. They invite us to practice. I have often taught that they are, more than any other teachers or teachings, our best teachers in the end because they speak to us personally and directly. <br /><br /><br /><br />As Leonard Cohen says, its the cracks that allow the light to get in. So, let us bless the imperfections and welcome them as teachers.<br /><br /><br /><br />Yours in the dharma.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Notes: Rev. Kobusshin and I have agreed that she will lead the services on Monday and Thursday mornings at 10:00 AM. I will lead on the other weekdays. I will occasionally ask her to lead on Sunday mornings, as well. <br /><br /><br /><br />Rev. Kobusshin will begin her class on the Great Heart of Wisdom Sutra on Monday the 16th at 7:00 PM. I have ordered four copies of the text for those who have asked for them. We will be using Thich Nhat Hahn’s translation and commentary, “The Heart of Understanding.” As a supplemental reading, we highly recommend Red Pine’s, “The Heart Sutra,” available in paperback through Amazon.com (I will not order these as I cannot afford the upfront cost right now). We will conclude our study of Master Dogen’s “Bendowa” this coming Monday evening.<br /><br /><br /><br />We still have openings for Zazenkai this coming Saturday. Please consider joining us. Register with Rev. Soku Shin by email.<br /><br /><br /><br />Lastly, I would like to remind everyone it is time to offer your dana to the Order of Clear Mind Zen. Your generosity is deeply appreciated.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Thank you very much.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
