<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Good Morning All, <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Our monthly Zazenkai (Intensive Meditation Day) is tomorrow from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM. We will offer a vegetarian meal served oryoki style and I will offer a Dharma Talk on “Making a Commitment to Peaceful Living.” Our practice schedule is listed on the Clear Mind Zen website at clearmindzen.org. We ask for a small $15.00 donation to assist us in covering our expenses. If you have not registered, but would like to attend all or part, please let me know ASAP by return email or phone (680-6680).<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I have received copies of the Heart Sutra text for Tamra/Shelley, Fred/Gloria and Leslie. They are in the Zendo. I would like to be reimbursed $8.00 for each copy. If anyone else should want a copy, please let me know. Rev. Kobusshin will begin her class on the Heart Sutra Monday the 16th at 7:00 PM.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Zazen at 10 today. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
