Aren't all new beginnings by definition, "new"?&nbsp; I suppose so, but this blog will represent a departure for me from my official capacity as abbot of the Order of Clear Mind Zen.&nbsp; Here I will write what I feel, think, and understand about my world.&nbsp; Sit down, lean back, and enjoy the ride.<br />
<br />
Ain't it grand?<br />
<br />
What?&nbsp; To be alive!<br />
<br />
Not really, been there, done that.<br />
<br />
Well dead man, here's a clue.&nbsp; No life, no thought.&nbsp; No thought, no you.&nbsp; So, I suppose 'thoughts without a thinker' is an oxymoron.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Be well y'all.<br />
