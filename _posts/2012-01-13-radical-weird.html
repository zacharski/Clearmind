Good Morning Zensters,<br />
<br />
So, last night I came to some decisions.&nbsp; Finally.&nbsp; First, I am on the Net to stay.&nbsp; Second, everything changes, always.&nbsp; So, we cannot count on anything.&nbsp; It is important that we really get this, that we get this in our bones.&nbsp; If we want to be happy we need to learn not to hang on to shit.&nbsp; let it go, wipe our butt and move on.<br />
<br />
Here's to flushing down the crap.<br />
Bows y'all<br />
