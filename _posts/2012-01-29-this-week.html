<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With respect, <br /><br /><br />Good Morning All,<br /><br /><br /><br />There is something about the morning that has forever inspired me. I think it must have something to do with the intersection of morning light and a fresh mind. Sleep, if one is so fortunate as to have had it, is a wonderful cleanser of the junk accumulated through a day and when we open our eyes to be greeted by the light, it is quite glorious.<br /><br /><br /><br />This week we will practice Zazen today at 10, Monday at 10 and 6, and Thursday at 10. Zen Study group will be Monday at 7. We will also practice street Zen at the Federal Building on Wednesday at 4.<br /><br /><br /><br />Saturday is our February Zazenkai. We begin at 8 and close at 4. A priestâ€™s meeting will follow. Please let me know if you plan to attend the Zazenkai.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well<br /><br /></div>
