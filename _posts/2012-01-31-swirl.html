<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With respect, <br /><br /><br />Good Morning All,<br /><br /><br /><br />While sitting with the morning light I caught a glimpse. Fleeting it was, Nothing can be held. Everything changes. Everything. Always. We say these things. Do we understand? And if we understand, do we realize? Words like everything and always offer an invitation to drop away the finite. Words like beginning, middle, and end refer to the finite and take away from the infinite. Moving, constantly moving, the universe seems a swirl when not in buddha’s eye. In truth, nothing is moving, nothing is changing, everything is nothing when all is one. Good grief. No wonder we say, don’t just do something, sit there! Or, in my case, eat toast with peanut butter. <br /><br />Be well.<br /><br /></div>
