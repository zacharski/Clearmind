<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With palms together<br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br />Today is the last day of Soku Shin’s retreat at Upaya in Sante Few. She did very well, braving sub-freezing temperatures and seven days of intensive seated practice. She will be finished at 3:00 PM, but will stay the night in Albuquerque in order to visit a family member. <br /><br />Intensive retreats are a foundation of our Zen practice. They are critical to our development, adding stamina and deep strength to our practice. Please consider joining us at our coming Zazenkai on Saturday the 4th from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM. <br /><br />Below is our schedule. You may enter and leave as necessary.<br /><br />This afternoon at 4:00 PM I will practice Street Zen at the Federal Building in Las Cruces. You are welcome to join me. Bring your cushion and bear witness. <br /><br />_____<br /><br />Zazenkai Schedule<br /><br />08:00-09:00 Zazen 2@25 <br /><br />09:00-10:00 Break/Samu <br /><br />10:00 - 11:30 Opening Ceremony, Sanpai, Robe Verse, Verse of Atonement, Three Refuges, the Heart Sutra, Tea Service, Teisho, Zazen 3@25 <br /><br />11:30-12:00 Samu/Break <br /><br />12:00-1:00 Lunch (Oryoki) <br /><br />1:00-2:00 Study <br /><br />2:00-3:30 Zazen 3@25 <br /><br />3:30-3:45 Closing Ceremonies: Hanya Shin Gyo, Four Vows, Incense Offering, Fueko <br /><br />3:45- 4:00 Prep for Meeting<br /><br />4:00- 6:00 Priest’s Meeting<br /><br />_______<br /><br />Be well<br /><br /></div>
