<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With respect,<br /><br /><br />An elderly man came upon the stage last night at the Cattleman’s. Shaky and unsure of himself, as he was just learning to play his guitar, he began to strum. Straining to see his sheet music in the stage lighting, he lost his place several times, tweaked a string or two, and started over two or three times. The elder was clearly on the verge of tears. <br /><br />Just then the organizer, who acted as stage manager, bolted out of his seat, grabbed his guitar out of its case, and nearly flew to the stage positioning himself behind the elder. The two finished the piece together. Then just as quickly, the organizer left the stage asking for a round of applause from the back. Bodhisattvas don’t think; they do.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well<br /><br /></div>
