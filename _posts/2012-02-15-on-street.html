<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With respect,<br /><br />This afternoon we will practice serene reflection meditation on the sidewalk in front of the Federal Building in downtown Las Cruces, NM.Street practice is a marvelously liberating practice:&nbsp;just yourself and your cushion under the bright, open sky.&nbsp; As I sit there I occasionally have the thought arise that this is exactly what the Buddha himself did.&nbsp; All of his thoughts, fears, and dreams come to mind.&nbsp; People walked past him as he practiced.&nbsp; Maybe they spoke to him, maybe not.&nbsp; Some friendly, some not.&nbsp; Perhaps he even had encounters with town authorities as he stood begging for food or addressed the social concerns of his day.&nbsp; Just so, me and you. Yes, its true.&nbsp; Buddha is none other than Everyman. Because this is so, as we sit, stand, walk, or lay down, we are experiencing exactly the same world as Buddha did.&nbsp; The face of that world may appear differently, but its true nature is the same.&nbsp; So, as we sip our morning coffee, run to the bathroom, or eat out toast, please do so with&nbsp;a &nbsp;mind as open as the sky and consider doing what you can do to make our world a better place.<br /><br />Be well.&nbsp;</div>
