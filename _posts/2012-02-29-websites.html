<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With respect <br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />Our two websites are now fully operational with the sole exception of the visitor blog option on the Engaged Zen site. We have additional content and graphics to add on each site,including an audio file of Matsuoka-roshi chanting the Hanya Shin Gyo, but in the main, they are complete. We will post scrolling announcements on each site frequently. The websites contain our Newcomer's Handbook, Registration Forms, and By-Laws. Copies of the Heart Sutra, Hsin Hsin Ming, and Sandokai are there as well as commentary on the Ten Ox-Herding pictures. These websites are well worth your viewing and we would very much like your feedback.<br /><br /><br /><br />Click here: http://clearmindzen.org<br /><br />and here: http://daihoroshi.org<br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.</div>
