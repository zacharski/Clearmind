<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With respect,<br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />Practice is the cornerstone of Zen. We practice not to become buddhas, but to realize our buddha nature. Zazen is a disciplined practice. While Zazen can be a home practice and even a workplace practice, our Zendo practice is foundational. Zazen should not be thought of as something to be done when it is convenient, it is not a practice one does if one has the time. Zazen practice is the highest priority for those who have stepped onto the path. It is a practice we make time for, period, end of sentence. <br /><br /><br /><br />As abbot and teacher, I encourage you to come to the Zendo as often as possible to practice Zazen. Our Zendo is available to you for your practice almost anytime. Our regularly scheduled practice times are Sunday through Thursday at 10:00 AM and Monday and Thursday evening at 6:00 PM. If these times are inconvenient and you would like to come to the Zendo at another time, a simple call to us will open the door. <br /><br /><br /><br />A word about our up-coming Intensive Retreat:<br /><br />We have reconsidered our Five Day Intensive Retreat Schedule and are changing it to accommodate those who are working or who are in school. We will do our Five Day Intensives in the following way: Wednesday through Friday from 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM, Saturday from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, and Sunday from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM. Our Hanamatsuri Intensive will thus begin at 6:00 PM on Wednesday, April 4th. Please register with Rev. Soku Shin as soon as possible.<br /><br /><br /><br />This evening we will continue our study of the Genjo koan and are still in Chapter Three of the text. We hope to see you at 10:00 AM this morning and at 6:00 PM this evening. Study Group is at 7:00 PM. <br /><br /><br /><br />May we each be a blessing in the universe.<br /><br /></div>
