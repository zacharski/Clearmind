<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With respect,<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Good Morning All,<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />It is quiet here in the Mesilla Valley. Other than an occasional car, birdsong is all that breaks the silence. We have just concluded our Hanamatsuri Sesshin and just afterwards, Soku Shin and I took the Hugger to Hatch and back. The Hugger is our Harley Davidson Sportster. It is the 883 version, but still packs cool power as we took the secondary road to Hatch where we ate green chilli at Sparky's.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />In honor of this new addition to our family, I bought still another copy of Zen &amp; the Art of Motorcycle Maintainance, that wonderful book by Pirsig that asks us to slow down and pay attention. Pirsig offers a slow, delicious ride into the everyday while on a long distance ride with friends and his son. He calls these lessons Chautauquas and asks us to explore our world deeply. This exploration, however, is not esoteric or exotic, it is based in the everyday.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />What can we know about anything without directly experiencing it? <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
