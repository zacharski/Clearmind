<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With respect, <br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />This morning I sat in the courtyard for Zazen.There was an early morning chill in the air and the neighborhood roosters were crowing in apparent delight. Some motorcycle, a crotch rocket I believe from the sound of it, was screaming down the highway obliterating the birdsong that otherwise would have caught my attention. Motorcycle engine, birds singing: our mind catches sound and evaluates it. One pleasant, one unpleasant, which is which? Soft and melodious, loud and mechanical, each in accordance with its nature. Accept both, hold neither. <br /><br /><br /><br />Formal Zen Sunday @ 9:00 AM at our residence. <br /><br /><br /><br />Be well.<br /><br /></div>
