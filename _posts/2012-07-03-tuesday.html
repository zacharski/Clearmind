<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">The sky is cloudy with heavy rain clouds. I am sitting in the courtyard with you. Suki and Emma are sitting withme. Binky is with Soku Shin who is not yet awake. The courtyard is awash with sounds of birds and insects. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I woke this morning with no pain in my leg, but the piriformis muscle is still very tight or I have a bruised hip joint. At least it is localized and not shooting down my leg.the procedure yesterday was simple and quick, as well as nearly painless. The Dr was terrific and asked for a card. She wants to learn zazen.<br /><br /><br /><br />We never know where or when we will meet a student of the Way. <br /><br /><br /><br />I would like to thank student Craig for his assistance yesterday. Craig came over in the heat of the afternoon and put together our inversion table for us. Thank you Craig!<br /><br /><br /><br />We will practice zazen tonight at 7:00 pm at the Temple. Please consider joining<br /><br />us. Gassho.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
