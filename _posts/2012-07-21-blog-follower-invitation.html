<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With palms together,<br />Good Morning Bloggers<br /><br />I would like to that you for being "followers" of my blog.&nbsp; I realized this morning that I rarely post anything on Blogger that I don't post in other venues.&nbsp; So, I want to invite you each to post a comment on the content of this blog and let me know how you feel about something.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you have followed my blog for some time you will know that I have often taken personal life and commented on it from a Zen perspective.&nbsp; I have done less of that of late.&nbsp; Moreover, I have not posted much about Zen and its practice either.&nbsp; What I want to know is this: do you prefer straight Zen talk or content from my everyday life with a Zen commentary?<br /><br />I look forward to hearing from you.<br /><br />Gassho</div>
