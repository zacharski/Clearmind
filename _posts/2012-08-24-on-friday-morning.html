<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />This morning we spent quite a bit of time cleaning and organizing the residence.&nbsp; Clearly I am limited in my abilityand capacity, but Rev. Soku Shin seems to have inhereted genes from the Energizer Bunny.&nbsp; I did manage to organize the studio/study and re-organize the courtyard funishings.&nbsp; But this pales in comparison to Ms. Bunny.&nbsp; <br /><br />This, as well as some discussions with my physical therapists have taken me aback.&nbsp; It is becoming quite clear that I will not recover to a state similar to that before I began experiencing leg pain.&nbsp; I will likely not run again, hike, or even walk very far.&nbsp; For someone who identified himself as physically active, a marathoner, and so on, this is a challenging reqality.<br /><br />Yet, every loss&nbsp;has the&nbsp;potential&nbsp;to be&nbsp;a teacher.&nbsp; Every moment, an oppoprtunity to rebirth myself.&nbsp; Closing one door, we often say, opens another.&nbsp; So, here I am with doors closing and other doors opening. The Zen of the Every Moment lies in this:&nbsp;the very existential view&nbsp;that our remaking ourselves moment to moment&nbsp;demands&nbsp;our adaptaion to impermanence.<br /><br /><br />Yesterday no longer exists, tomorrow is simply a fantasy: it is in the eternal now that we reside.&nbsp; May we each live as fully as possible.<br /><br />Be well.<br /></div>
