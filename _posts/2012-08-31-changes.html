<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With respect,<br /><br />It would appear I am facing yet another major change in my life. Kathryn and I have decided we will no longer live together. I am moving back into the Temple and will take it as my residence. This will mean some reconfiguration of the space, but is possible. I do not want much space and do not need most of the things I have collected. <br /><br />Its odd how these things unfold. In this case it was a rather sudden and deeply disturbing change. I do not wish to share the details, but suffice to say, it was necessary.<br /><br />I will share more as I am able and the situation allows.<br /><br />Be well.</div>
