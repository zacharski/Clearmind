<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With palms together,<br /><br />This is Labor Day and I think we have forgotten its meaning.&nbsp; Contrary to the comments back that I receive in passing about this weekend being a long weekend, it is&nbsp;in fact &nbsp;meant to honor those who actually labor to earn a living. Labor is a word we tend not to apply to ourselves.&nbsp; Labor conjures up images of factory workers, construction workers, and laborers, not management-level desk jockeys, bean counters and pencil pushers. Labor Day honors those who actually&nbsp;work for a living. And most of us really don't have much of a clue as to what that really means.&nbsp; <br /><br />My father was a house painter most of his life and a maintenance man in a hospital in his later years.&nbsp; I remember him coming home with overalls covered in paint spatter.&nbsp; My brother was a refrigeration man.&nbsp; And I spent a good part of my early adult life as a dishwasher, short order cook and pie maker, before I "moved up" into management, graduated late in life from college, and went on to become a psychotherapist.<br /><br />From my experience, labor requires sweat.&nbsp; Labor requires the ability to get a job done often under awful circumstances and keep our mouths shut in the process.&nbsp; It requires us to&nbsp;be deferential and socially appropriate when those "above us" don't give us much more than the time of day...that is, if they actually see us at all. Yet here we are celebrating "Labor" while most of those who actually labor must labor on this day while those who don't labor enjoy a back yard Bar-B-Que. <br /><br />What would actually honor those who labor would be for us who don't labor to labor for one day in their place.&nbsp; Never happen.<br /><br />Be well.<br /><br /></div>
