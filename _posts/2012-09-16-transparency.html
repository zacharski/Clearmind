<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With respect,<br /><br />Yesterday I posted a note that included information about my personal life. A member replied saying politely that my personal life was none of his business.&nbsp; Those who have been reading my posts over the last 12 years or so know that I frequently use events in my personal life as exemplars of the challenges of Zen living. While this is useful to students, I think there is another more fundamental reason for such postings.&nbsp; <br /><br />In the world of Zen there have been far too many examples of secrecy among teachers leading to the very real possibility of harm to their sanghas. I have always felt I should be as transparent as possible so as to avoid this. But more importantly, I see personal and professional as an artificial dualism. My life has been an open book.&nbsp; Seamless, if you will.&nbsp; I believe strongly in self disclosure as both a teaching tool and method of insuring authenticity.<br /><br />Clearly I have made mistakes, but I see these as teaching tools both for myself and my readers. We cannot live our lives without error.&nbsp; And as this is so, why not use error as a teacher rather than something to retreat from or hide?<br /><br />Students should know their teachers are human beings and titles and degrees are not guarantees of infallibility.<br /><br />May we each be well and make ourselves a blessing in the universe.</div>
