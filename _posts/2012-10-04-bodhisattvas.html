<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With palms together,<br /><br /><br />Good Afternoon Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />An old acquaintance who once visited me at the mountain refuge wrote:<br /><br />Dear Harvey,<br /><br /><br /><br />Thought you might like some reaction to your rather down news lately. We haven't known each other much or long, but you feel like an old friend. I very much do appreciate your openness in posting about your health and relationships, and it certainly is powerful Zen teaching in showing how a person of Zen responds to challenges. You have my admiration.<br /><br /><br /><br />At the same time, I feel sad for your sake. If only the words of Dick Fariña were true for me and you —<br /><br /><br /><br />Well, if somehow you could pack up your sorrows,<br /><br />And give them all to me.<br /><br />You would lose them, I know how to use them,<br /><br />Give them all to me. <br /><br /><br /><br />But I am far from that kind of Bodhisattva as yet. This is the best I can do. Hope this helps.<br /><br /><br /><br />____<br /><br />I replied:<br /><br />Dear ____, it’s not sad, really, it’s more exciting than sad although there are sad moments. I feel invigorated by the prospect of divorce and committing to my life with Kathryn, a woman who has truly been my partner over the last three years. It’s very much like a rebirth I suspect.<br /><br />My physical condition is a challenge but I embrace it wholeheartedly. We should not be surprised or dismayed overmuch as our bodies begin to come apart as we age. At 65 I'm happy enough to still be alive. The pain is just another companion.<br /><br />I hope you are well and happy. Thank you for writing. It is always good to hear from you.<br /><br />____<br /><br /><br /><br />My acquaintance is indeed a bodhisattva. He lives alone far away in the north east. He makes malas, very beautiful malas, and in this message helped me very much. It is in their small kindnesses and occasional acknowledgements, that bodhisattvas are found.<br /><br />Be well.<br /><br /></div>
