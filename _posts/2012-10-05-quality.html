<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br /><br />Fall is clearly upon us in southern New Mexico. The morning air is decidedly cooler even though the late afternoon temps still reach 90. I am waiting patiently for our first real cold snap, that event that triggers leaves turning and pumpkins to be carved. <br /><br />Patience has never been one of my virtues.&nbsp; I have always been an intuitive person who leaps onto something and makes it happen. Lately, however, I seem to be doing much less of that, hell, much less of anything, preferring instead the comfort of sitting quietly with my Soku Shin, our dogs, and perhaps a glass of wine. Perhaps this is a result of <span style="background-color: yellow;">the </span>pain I experience daily, but I think it is more likely simple aging with a loving partner who enjoys my company..&nbsp; <br /><br />We often do nothing but sit together and talk, yet we've noticed&nbsp;our most&nbsp;loving and life enhancing&nbsp;conversations are those we have while laying next to each other in our bed on our sides facing each other under blankets.Such intimate, softly spoken moments are delicious. They are to be savored like a fine meal with a marvelous dessert. They take time.<br /><br />At this stage of my life I am much less interested in making things happen, let the young ones do that, instead, I am much more interested in the moment to moment quality of my life. That quality, of course, is always there, but it takes both patience and practice to bring it to the surface. <br /><br />Yours,</div>
