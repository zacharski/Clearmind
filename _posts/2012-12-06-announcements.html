<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With palms together,<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Good Morning All,<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />We begin Rohatsu sesshin this evening and will continue thru Sunday at noon. Rohatsu is a very special time of year for us as we celebrate and honor the Buddhaâ€™s enlightenment through our practice. On Saturday at 10:00 AM we will honor Polly Skikan Perez as she becomes a novitiate priest and Rev. Soku Shin as she undergoes Shukke Tokudo and becomes a full priest in our Order. On Sunday at 10:00 AM we will also honor Tucker for taking the Refuges, Mitsugo for taking Jukai, Ryugin for becoming a Novitiate Zen priest, and, of course, Revs Daishugyo and Shoji as they undergo Shukke Tokudo becoming full priests in our Order. Friends and family are welcome. Please consider joining us for these events as well as to take advantage of our many opportunities to practice.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />May you each be well and free from suffering<br /><br /></div>
