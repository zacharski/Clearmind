<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With respect to all,<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />After due consideration, I have reduced the price of my downloadable Kindle book, "The Zen of Trauma" to $0.99. If you wish to download this book, go to Amazon.com and search for the title. It is a Kindle edition and you may download it to your PC or MAC if you also download the free Kindle software. <br /><br /><br /><br />I am putting the finishing touches on my next little book, "The Zen of Everyday Life" which will be the second in the series.<br /><br /><br /><br />Yours,<br /><br />Daiho<br /><br /></div>
