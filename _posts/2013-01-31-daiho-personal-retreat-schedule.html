<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With palms together,<br /><br /><br />Good Morning All,<br /><br /><br /><br />As many of you know, Rev. Shukke Shin and I have established a routine wherein I practice a personal retreat at the Zendo the first weekend of each month and she does the same in El Paso on the third weekend. My retreat begins on Thursday evening at 7:00 PM and continues through Sunday service. As it happens, then, I will host Zazenkai each first Saturday and lead services on the first Sunday. This schedule will also be our Sesshin schedule at each quarter.<br /><br /><br /><br />All are welcome to join me at the Temple during my retreat. It is always good to have others to practice with and I would deeply appreciate your company. There is one exception to the schedule below. This Friday I have an appointment to have my motorcycle serviced at 9:00 AM on Friday. This should not take more than two hours. I will return to the Temple after it is completed.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Roshiâ€™s Personal Retreat Schedule<br /><br /><br /><br />Thursday Evening<br /><br />07:00-8:00 PM Zazen and Closing Ceremonies<br /><br /><br /><br />Friday and Saturday <br /><br />04:30 Wake and Wash<br /><br />05:00-06:30 Gym<br /><br />06:30-07:30 Breakfast<br /><br />07:30-09:00 Recite Three Refuges, Wisdom Heart Sutra, Opening Tea Service, Teisho, Zazen: Three Periods<br /><br />09:00-10:00 Walk/Jog <br /><br />10:00-11:00 Zazen: Two Periods<br /><br />11:00-11:30 Break<br /><br />12:00-01:00 Lunch<br /><br />01:00-01:30 Zazen: One Period<br /><br />01:30-02:30 Samu<br /><br />02:30-03:30 Zazen: Two Periods <br /><br />03:30-05:00 Writing/Study Practice/Break<br /><br />05:00-07:00 Dinner, Samu<br /><br />07:00-08:00 Zazen: Two Periods<br /><br />08:00 Close, Recite the Hanya Shin Gyo, the Four Great Vows.<br /><br /><br /><br />Sunday <br /><br />04:30-05:00 Wake and Wash<br /><br />05:00-06:30 Gym<br /><br />06:30-07:30 Breakfast<br /><br />07:30-10:00 Zazen, Break and Samu<br /><br />10:00-11:30 Sunday Services<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
