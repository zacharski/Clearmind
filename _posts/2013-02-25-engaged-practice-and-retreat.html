<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With Palms together,<br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br />Zen is much larger than a Zendo. It is life itself. We move from the wall to the open air, as the Buddha did in his lifetime. When I began this Order I envisioned it to practice in a Zendo without walls. It is certain that wall sitting is important and can be done in our own homes either alone or in small groups. Yet, the mission of Engaged Practice is to actually engage. <br /><br /><br /><br />I will resume park and street practice shortly and offer to each of you the invitation to join me. I encourage each of you to establish an Engaged Practice in your area serving vulnerable populations, your community, or the nation at large. It’s not that difficult: the need is everywhere; in every city and town and even in rural areas. Homelessness, poverty, death and dying, and violence know no geographic limits. Please consider this. <br /><br />Be well.<br /><br />PS. In the meantime, as I indicated in an earlier note, I will hold a Personal Retreat beginning Thursday evening this week. Zazenkai will be on Saturday. If you would like to participate, please join me. This will be my schedule:<br /><br /><br /><br />Roshi’s Personal Retreat Schedule: First Week of Each Month<br /><br />Zazenkai Schedule, revised<br /><br /><br /><br />Thursday Evening<br /><br />07:00-8:00 PM Zazen and Closing Ceremonies<br /><br /><br /><br />Friday and Saturday (Zazenkai)<br /><br />04:30 Wake and Wash<br /><br />05:00-06:30 Exercise<br /><br />06:30-07:30 Breakfast<br /><br />(Zazenkai begins here on Saturday)<br /><br />07:30-09:00 Recite Three Refuges, Wisdom Heart Sutra, Opening Tea Service, Teisho, Zazen: Three Periods<br /><br />09:00-10:00 Walk/Jog <br /><br />10:00-11:00 Zazen: Two Periods<br /><br />11:00-11:30 Break<br /><br />12:00-01:00 Lunch (Oryoki on Saturday Zazenkai)<br /><br />01:00-01:30 Zazen: One Period<br /><br />01:30-02:30 Samu<br /><br />02:30-03:30 Zazen: Two Periods <br /><br />03:30-04:30 Writing/Study Practice<br /><br />04:30-05:00 Zazen: One Period<br /><br />05:00-06:00 Dinner<br /><br />06:00-06:30 Samu<br /><br />06:30-08:00 Zazen: Three Periods<br /><br />08:00 Close, Recite the Hanya Shin Gyo, the Four Great Vows.<br /><br /><br /><br />Sunday <br /><br />04:30-05:00 Wake and Wash<br /><br />05:00-5:30 Zazen: One Period<br /><br />05:30-06:30 Writing Practice<br /><br />06:30-07:30 Breakfast<br /><br />07:30-10:00 Clean-up, Pack, Prepare Zendo<br /><br />10:00-11:30 Sunday Services<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
