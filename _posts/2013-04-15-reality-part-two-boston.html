<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With palms together,<br /><br /><br />I bow to each reader,<br /><br /><br /><br />This evening let us each offer incense and a recitation of the Heart Sutra on behalf of those injured in Boston this afternoon. Such events are unimaginable and unconscionable. Yet, we live in a time when events like this occur around the globe. <br /><br /><br /><br />We are all asking questions, seeking answers, and needing someone or some group to blame. For me, I know blame is a tricky thing as it keeps me away from the event itself. Surviving trauma is like that : we want to make sense of the irrational. Donâ€™t try. <br /><br /><br /><br />We already know what we need to know. We just need to look deeply into our own hearts. We are human beings who love and hate, seek justice often with revenge, and want punishment for those responsible for hurting us. <br /><br /><br /><br />Turn to your faith tradition and its practices. Notice the love and compassion we feel for those hurt and for those who so quickly aided the injured. So, while the world is a place with danger and outrageous acts, it is also a place of great love and self sacrifice. <br /><br /><br /><br />May we each be a blessing in this universe of ours,<br /><br /><br /><br />Yours<br /><br />Daiho<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
