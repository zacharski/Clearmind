<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With palms together,<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />As most of you are aware, we have been thoroughly busy with packing, moving, changing around the Zendo, a roadtrip to South Dakota, and just yesterday, a trip to Albuquerque. In the works is a visit from Zen teacher, author, and rebel Zenster, Brad Warner. Brad has agreed to come to El Paso and Las Cruces in July. I believe he will be in El Paso on the 12th and here in Cruces on the 14th. He has published a new book, "There is No God and He is Always With You" which I am reviewing. I can tell you it is a very good read; thought provoking and insightful.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Since we have been so busy, I have given some thought to our Engaged practice. I think it is best to continue to do park and street practice on Wednesdays at the Federal Building at 5:00 PM and at Veteran's Park on Roadrunner at 9:00 AM Fridays. I will no longer sit at the City Hall park on Mondays. Zazen will continue on Thursday evenings at 7:00 PM and on Sundays at 10:00 AM. I would very much like to contain dokusan to Thursdays and Fridays if at all possible. And I would like to accomplish these at my residence.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />If you would care to meet with me, please call me at 575-680-6680 or email me at harveyhilbert@yahoo.com<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Yours in the Dharma,<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Daiho<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
