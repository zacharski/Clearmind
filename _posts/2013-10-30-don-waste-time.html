<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With palms together,<br /><br /><br />Good Morning Everyone, <br /><br /><br /><br />Last night our Study Group finished our study of “Living by Vow,” an excellent commentary on the key chants used in our Zen tradition. Next week we will begin our study of “Moku-Rai” a text of writings by Rev. Dr. Soyu Matsuoka-roshi. <br /><br /><br /><br />In our group last night we closed out the Sandokai’s last verse, the first section reads:<br /><br /><br /><br />Hearing the words, you should understand the source:<br /><br />Don’t make up standards of your own.<br /><br />If you don’t understand the path as it meets your eyes,<br /><br />How can you know the way as you walk? (p.246)<br /><br /><br /><br />As in a segment of the Heart Sutra, we should begin in the vast emptiness of Samadhi. This emptiness is the Buddha Nature from which all things manifest, including standards for life. To make up standards of our own separates us from our True Nature and creates duality. Meeting the path as it meets your eyes is an admonition to only go straight, doing what is in front of you to do.<br /><br /><br /><br />Duality has no ground. It is relative. Discussion of philosophy and logic cannot lead us to non-duality, only practice does that. As Okumura points out, “Any theoretical system of concepts or thoughts is a distorted copy of reality. We can only practice it, experience it, and nod our head.” (p. 247)<br /><br /><br /><br />This is very important and often ignored by students and teachers alike. We human beings love to think about things, talk about things, and sit for hours with coffee contemplating things. True Zen demands we put a stop to this wasted effort. If we want to get to the source, we must practice letting go of our ego-self so that the source may be seen. The source then manifests through our actions. <br /><br /><br /><br />“I humbly say to those who study the mystery,<br /><br />Don’t waste time.” <br /><br /><br /><br />In this last line, we may see Dogen’s source for his first lines in the Shushogi, ”The most important issue for all Buddhists is the thorough clarification of the meaning of birth and death.”<br /><br />Be well<br /><br /></div>
