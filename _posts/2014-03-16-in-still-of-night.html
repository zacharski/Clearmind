<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">With palms together,</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Good Morning Everyone,</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">There are nights while, when sitting still, the universe reveals itself. It seems to whisper in the stillness as if its breath comes from the lips of God.&nbsp; On such nights I am comforted by such fancy thoughts, knowing full well the universe and the breeze are just the universe and the breeze. Still, the comfort comes.</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">I listened to a rant by Bill Maher earlier about the story of Noah.&nbsp; Bill was beside himself.&nbsp; He cannot believe human beings actually believe this story and take it as the literal truth.&nbsp; Frankly, neither can I.&nbsp; However, Bill nearly always misses the point, blinded as he is by his hatred of religion as he understands it. I admit, if my understanding of God and religion were as shallow and superficially fundamentalist as his, I would hate them as well. The thing is, God is a concept (pardon me John), But what that concept hides is something else again.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">To offer an example:&nbsp; I am Harvey, yet “Harvey” is a concept.&nbsp; What <i>is</i> Harvey is far more or less than the concept “Harvey.” It would be a mistake to think that Harvey, in the concrete, empirical sense, is Harvey in the metaphysical sense.&nbsp; One is a finger pointing to the other. What we need is to understand one is not the other.</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Sitting outside under the stars in the middle of the night allows for something to emerge.&nbsp; What shall we call it?&nbsp; Rudolf Otto called it the <i>mysterium tremendous </i>in his seminal book,<i> The Idea of the Holy.</i> We can touch this only when we have released our own protective coverings.&nbsp; When “body/mind fall away.” And when this actually happens?&nbsp; Words fail us: not even the moon is the moon anymore.</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">When I listen to Bill, or any other fundamentalist, I feel for them because I know their ownership of their ideas is locked up tight and as such they will never truly be alive…or awake. Instead they will self-righteously miss the poetry as the universe itself recites.</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Here’s a link to his rant:<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/15/bill-maher-god-psychotic-mas-murderer_n_4970831.html?ncid=fcbklnkushpmg00000013&amp;ir=Politics"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"> Bill</span></a></span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Be well</span></div><br /><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div></div>
