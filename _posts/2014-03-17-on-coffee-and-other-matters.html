<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">With palms together,</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Good Morning Everyone,</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">The taste of coffee in the morning is like an old, old friend.&nbsp; There was a time when I would drink several pots of coffee a day. I often worked 13 hour days, nearly always six days a week, for years and and a cup of coffee with every client was a welcomed way of taking a break without appearing to do so.&nbsp; I could pour the cups, stir, breath a few breaths, then come back into the consulting room and sit down.&nbsp; After chit chatting for a few minutes over the coffee we were ready to begin the therapy.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">In the before time, I was a psychotherapist and businessman.&nbsp; I started a private practice with a hundred bucks while in the PhD program at CWRU and after ten years sold the practice and escaped the “corporate” world.&nbsp; It was an exciting time to be in the field.&nbsp; Lots of innovation, lots of money, and lots of stress.&nbsp; It was in that climate I began to see the value in, and do the more formal practice of, meditation. &nbsp;</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Of course in the beginning most of us clinicians saw meditation as a tool.&nbsp; We did not see it in the larger context of a “spiritual” practice, yet there it was.&nbsp; I remember taking a seminar on meditation put on by some ‘self-hypnosis’ group or other and found myself actually amazed at the power of guided meditation.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">One of the most important things I took away from those years was the practice of mindfulness. I was dedicated at it’s practice.&nbsp; I literally saw myself doing, feeling, seeing, tasting, smelling, and touching everything, and, at some point with true mindfulness, which is to say, without tagging it.</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">It’s beautiful and effortless. My coffee is getting cold.&nbsp; To exist in mindfulness, do not say, drinking coffee, I am aware I am drinking coffee.”&nbsp; Instead, just drink the coffee as fully and completely as you can without separating yourself from the coffee and the cup. &nbsp;</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Try it, you’ll like it.</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Gassho</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Daiho</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><br /><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><br /></div></div>
