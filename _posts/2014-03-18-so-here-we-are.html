<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">With palms together,</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Good Morning Everyone,</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">This morning I woke at 4:45!&nbsp; Late for me.&nbsp; After siting a bit, I watched an episode of a James Spader show called,"Blacklist" and it got me thinking.&nbsp; Big problem! :)&nbsp; Anyway, I acknowledge we all do things in our lifetimes which erode our sense of self-esteem.&nbsp; And we all witness and do things that raise our sense of hope and open our hearts to love.&nbsp; Sometimes these are events that are coincident. Which can be one way of saying at times the end justifies the means.&nbsp; Yet, we must ask ourselves, "is our sense of self-esteem and the warming of our hearts so important that we can justify an action otherwise judged as horrific?" If it feels good it's ok to do it?&nbsp; Not always.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Today our study group will take up the question of the meaning our our own lives.&nbsp; As we approach death, which by the way, is an every breath proposition, we may begin to wonder about the value of our lives.&nbsp; As an aged person, I am obliged (I suspect I have little choice) to address these issues as one of the final unresolved conflicts in Erickson’s life stage model.&nbsp; But, I suspect such a reflection and introspective task may be a god idea for any of us no matter where we are on life’s so-called “highway.”</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">What have I learned that I believe has value to my children and the world at large? Has my life been meaningful, and if so, how?&nbsp; In what way?</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">I don’t know.&nbsp; I do know that any answer I might give right now will be an advertisement.&nbsp; It will be a refection of a construction, the result of selected memories pasted together to form some sort of cohesive idea of who I think I am and what import I have or what impact I have had over the 67 years of my lifetime. &nbsp;</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">My sense at this point is that what I say or what I believe about myself is far less important than the journey we each take in discovering this truth.&nbsp; To sit in Zazen, facing ourselves, ids to sit facing our construction.&nbsp; Over time, the construction begins to come apart.&nbsp; Our stories about ourselves begin to erode or the light of introspection clarifies the distortions, opens new pathways to&nbsp; a changing, constantly changing, understanding of ourselves.&nbsp; We are left with nothing substantial.&nbsp; And so it is.</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Our lives exist on a constantly shifting stage.&nbsp; Our lives themselves are a fiction, as our lives are not what we believe them to be.&nbsp; We are not independent creatures living without the need for others.&nbsp; We depend on others, others depend on us.&nbsp; Yes, form is emptiness, emptiness is form.</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><br /><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Be well.</span></div></div>
