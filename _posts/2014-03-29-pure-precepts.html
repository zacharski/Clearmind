<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">With palms together,</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Good Morning All,</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">We stood at attention, each with an American flag held close.&nbsp; The sun was on us, but there was a cool breeze and we were not uncomfortable.&nbsp; There were a number of us, perhaps twenty, on that line outside the front doors of the funeral home.&nbsp; Inside lay a fallen Vietnam Veteran, aged 65, and his family and friends.&nbsp; We were part of an Honor Guard coming from all points in the southwest on our motorcycles and this was our mission: to stand with him.</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">On my left stood a man, maybe 60, who just had a round of chemo for a lung cancer developed as a result of working in a plastics factory.&nbsp; He was not very strong, but he stood his ground as he related the story of his diagnosis and treatment. On my right was a former soldier, much younger, and I do not know what theater he fought in.&nbsp; He was from Alamogordo and I did not know him.&nbsp; He kept pretty much to himself as we stood there with our flags. &nbsp;</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">I thought of myself as bearing witness to our military’s retired and discharged.&nbsp; Those who stepped up and faced mortal danger and while I do not believe in war as a means to resolve conflict, I do believe in the men and women who offer themselves on their country’s behalf whether in war or in peace.&nbsp; It seems to me each of us have our civic responsibilities: the military, the peace corp, volunteering to help at homeless shelters, in schools, or in other ways; selfless service to something larger than oneself. I am honored to know such people and I feel badly for those who believe there is no such responsibility and who believe there is no social contract between us as citizens of a nation or world. People who hold such a view must feel lonely and isolated indeed.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">In Zen we vow to cease doing evil,&nbsp; vow to do good, and vow to bring about abundant good for all beings. For me:&nbsp; Evil is an understanding that there're beings separate from others. Good is an understanding of no separation.&nbsp; And creating conditions for good to arise, well, this is a natural outcome of living together, caring for and about each other, and having an understanding that what affects one affects all.&nbsp; Being a person who has taken these vows, I cannot help but love my neighbor as myself.</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">May we each take up these vows and manifest them in our everyday practice.</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Be well,</span></div><br /><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Daiho</span></div></div>
