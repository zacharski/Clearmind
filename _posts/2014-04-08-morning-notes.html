<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">With palms together,</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Good Morning All,</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">This morning I woke at 4:30!&nbsp; Yeah, getting a bit more rest!&nbsp; I do love early morning: quiet earth, starlit sky, cool desert air, and birdsong.&nbsp; All of these combine to make early morning very special in my heart.&nbsp; And then there is the morning light of dawn breaking!&nbsp; I longed for that light in Vietnam.&nbsp; It meant the dark night was over and I had survived the treacherous night.&nbsp; Naive.&nbsp; There are, and continue to be, dark nights.&nbsp; Today, I address them directly, however, although there were decades where I hid from them.&nbsp; I guess I’m getting better at 67 years old.&nbsp; Like someone mumbled at the “Welcome Home Vietnam Veterans” rally last week, “Its about damn time!”</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">We should never hide from ourselves.&nbsp; In Zen, it is nearly impossible to do so, although some of us manage.&nbsp; I say nearly impossible because when we practice zazen we have nothing but ourselves to consider.&nbsp; There is you, your cushion, and the wall in front of your eyes.&nbsp; We sit and as we do, the wall becomes a mirror.&nbsp; If we do not avert our eyes, everything has the potential to become clear. I need not say more about this, as it will be your experience, not mine.</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Anyway, about business:&nbsp; I would like to ask that if you are planning to attend sesshin this weekend, please let me know the dates you will be here.&nbsp; The same for our Google Hangouts “service” on this coming Monday evening at 7:30 PM Mountain Time.&nbsp; I will need to know your Google email address.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Our Tuesday Study group will meet at my residence at 6:30 PM.&nbsp; For those of you with the text we will be discussing chapter three.&nbsp; All are welcome.</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Lastly, if you have not offered dana or dues, please consider doing so soon.&nbsp; Our rent is due a week from this Wednesday. &nbsp;</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Be well.</span></div><br /><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Daiho</span></div></div>
