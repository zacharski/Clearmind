<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">With palms together,</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Good Afternoon All,</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14px; min-height: 17px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">I haven’t posted to my blog since way before I took the road trip I am currently doing.&nbsp; Since leaving Las Cruces I’ve put nearly 4000 miles on the Dyna, endured pounding rain, major delays in miles and miles of construction, and blind drivers apparently unable to see (or hear) a Harley Davidson motorcycle. I’ve learned a few things through it all. First, my dislike of crowds and anxiety when within them was re-enforced by my experience at the national meeting of the Combat Veterans Motorcycle Association in Gettysburg, Pa. While not news to me, my response was awkward to say the least. It was rather severe. I pretty much stayed in my room and after two days acknowledged it wasn’t good for me to be there.&nbsp; So, uncharacteristically for me (since I typically tough such things out), I simply climbed on the Dyna and left.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14px; min-height: 17px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">On the ride towards home I had the opportunity to meet Student Tucker’s mom and step-father.&nbsp; They were incredibly kind and gracious, offering me a room in their beautiful home and a terrific meal accompanied by delightful conversation.&nbsp; Along the way I had the opportunity to sample fresh watermelon at the Arkansas border, see wondrous birds, find a hidden wild strawberry, and delight of delights, meet and chat with folks at my frequent stops. second lesson: stop often, enjoy what’s in front of you.</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14px; min-height: 17px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">I am now sitting on the square in Georgetown, Texas in front of my son’s&nbsp;</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">restaurant, “The Hollow,”&nbsp; enjoying a beer in the heat of the afternoon.&nbsp; Life, it seems, couldn't get any better with the exception that I miss the love of my life, Kathryn, greatly. So, in the morning I will saddle-up the Dyna and ride off toward the southwest.</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14px; min-height: 17px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Third lesson: I have discovered that I really do not have anything more to teach, as if I ever really did.&nbsp; Being a “Zen Teacher” is somewhat an oxymoron. One does not, can not, “teach” Zen.&nbsp; One simply experiences it. Perhaps “Zen Mentor” or “Fellow Practitioner” might be better terminology. These do not carry the bullshit narratives that often come with titles such as “Zen Master,”&nbsp; Zen “Teacher,” or “Roshi.” Next to life lived as it is, my words are nothing.&nbsp; So, if I have any practical advice it would be this” Live.</span></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14px; min-height: 17px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span><br /></div><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Yours,</span></div><br /><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Daiho&nbsp;</span></div></div>
