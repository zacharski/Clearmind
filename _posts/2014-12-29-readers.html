<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With palms together,<br />Dear Readers,<br /><br />Recently I retired from my leadership role at the Order of Clear Mind Zen. &nbsp;A new abbot has taken my place and the three local Zen sanghas have come together under one roof to be now referred to as Daibutsuji Zen Temple with its headquarters at the Zen Center of Las Cruces. &nbsp;I am pleased at these developments. &nbsp;The new abbot, Rev. Shukke Shin-sensei, has tons of new ideas and brings a younger, fresher face to the Sangha.<br /><br />The Order of Clear Mind Zen will continue but not as a formal corporate entity. &nbsp;We are a religious Order upon which our priests and lay precept holders are trained and ordained. &nbsp;I will continue to be its head teacher and will continue my work with my students. &nbsp;While initially I thought I would no longer accept students, I believe I am changing my mind and will, indeed, &nbsp;begin to accept new students and teach. &nbsp;It's what I do.<br /><br />If you should wish to become my student please email me at daihoroshi@gmail.com telling me something of your background and interests. We will then schedule an initial interview. &nbsp;I accept students from all over the world and offer interviews through Skype or FaceTime.<br /><br />I will be using this blog site in conjunction with Facebook and my website (daihoroshi.org) as primary venues for my written work and notes regarding my activities and so forth. &nbsp;If you should wish to friend me on Facebook, please send me a friend request. My Facebook name is "Sodaiho."<br /><br /><br />Enough,<br />Take time to practice Zazen today even if its just five minutes.,<br />Yours,<br /><br />Daiho</div>
