Be quiet. &nbsp;Rest easy in the world. &nbsp;The Zen of Nothing contains no evil, nor good, nor blessings, nor curses. &nbsp;It is not hot or cold, far or near. <br /><br />Let your body feel it. &nbsp;Let your mind open in it. &nbsp;Let your heart dance to the sound of one hand.<br /><br />The Zen of Nothing arrives when we stop singing the songs of the Zen of Something.<br /><br />Be well.</div></div></div></div>
