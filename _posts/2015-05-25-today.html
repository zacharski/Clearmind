<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With respect to all,<br /><br /><div style="color: #141823; font-family: helvetica, arial, 'lucida grande', sans-serif; line-height: 19px; margin-bottom: 6px;">So, this was Memorial Day, a day of remembrance and gratitude. This day means different things to different people. And for some, different things within the same person. I know I am conflicted about it. As I am sure many combat veterans are, as well. Many of us are caught in flashbacks, terrible memories, great anxiety, and in this, who really wants to remember? And am I to be grateful for surviving when others did not?&nbsp;</div><div style="color: #141823; font-family: helvetica, arial, 'lucida grande', sans-serif; line-height: 19px; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 6px;">On the other hand I cannot help but feel obligate<span class="text_exposed_show" style="display: inline;">d to assist on this day. I tear up with the raising of the flag, the pledge, and the myriad prayers people offer. It is a good thing to remember: when we forget, bad things are free to happen again. History repeats itself only if we choose to repeat it.&nbsp;</span></div><div class="text_exposed_show" style="color: #141823; display: inline; font-family: helvetica, arial, 'lucida grande', sans-serif; line-height: 19px;"><div style="margin-bottom: 6px;">To paraphrase what I said to a friend recently who admonished us to remember, "remembering is not a problem" war is with me in each and every breath. My struggle, if you will, is to open my heart to peace, a place I find difficult to trust. In this I wish we would approach peace-making with the same fervency that we approach war. I would like us to memorialize peace, celebrate love, and invest in ways of making the world a better place; all without armies. Is that too much to ask?</div><div style="margin-bottom: 6px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 6px;">Be well,</div><div style="margin-bottom: 6px;">Daiho</div></div></div>
