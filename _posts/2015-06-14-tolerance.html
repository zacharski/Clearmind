<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With respect to all,<br /><br />The other day in a conversation with a biker veteran who, I might add, is just completing his Masters degree, &nbsp;I was reminded of the difference between tolerance and acceptance. &nbsp;When I worked in the T or C school system I recall receiving teaching materials related to tolerance. &nbsp;At the time I didn't give it much thought, though I believe I thought it was a good idea. &nbsp;I think now, I was wrong. &nbsp;Teaching tolerance is about teaching us to use forbearance in order not to rock the boat. &nbsp;We stifle ourselves when we come across something that really bothers us. &nbsp;I ask a simple question, then, how does a stifling of meaningful difference help us get along? &nbsp;It doesn't. &nbsp;What it teaches us to do is "tolerate" each other, in spite of our differences. &nbsp;While this approach allows each faith tradition to practice, it does nothing to bring us together since we are simply tolerating each other. &nbsp;The problem then is this: how can we come to accept difference between faith traditions? <br /><br />One way, I've learned, is to seek commonalities. &nbsp;When we can see that we have things in common, compassion, for example, we may have something to build on. &nbsp;Finding commonalities is easy, actually, I've done it many times in mediation sessions with clients. &nbsp;What is not so easy is finding ways to live with the differences &nbsp;An example: &nbsp;I lived for years in the deep[ south where fundamentalist Christians are in the majority. &nbsp;These are caring people, though (IMHO) misguided. &nbsp;Blue laws prevailed there. &nbsp;These were laws based on Christian understanding of their bible. &nbsp;So, stores, by law, had to be closed on Sunday. &nbsp;Nothing really wrong with that, right? &nbsp;Wrong. &nbsp;From my religious POV, the Sabbath is on a Saturday, and this, folks, is what that very same bible actually says. &nbsp;If a Jew wanted to shop on Sunday he was out of luck. &nbsp;Conversely, the fact that stores were allowed to be open on Saturday desecrated the sabbath from a Jewish point of view. &nbsp;We could say, "so what" there aren't that many Jews, besides we're a Christian country aren't we? &nbsp;Not really, but we can avoid the facts and stick to the myth...<br /><br />Which brings us to this, should Jews in our example simply tolerate the desecration of the sabbath? &nbsp;Or should Christians understand there are differences between faith traditions within the same Abrahamic line (in this case) &nbsp;and be willing to see and understand difference. &nbsp;Tolerate? &nbsp;Respect?<br /><br />For me the key is to learn, deeply learn, about each faith tradition. &nbsp;Once we actually know something about a tradition we are in a place where mutual respect can arise. &nbsp;Even if we differ on issues it is possible to respect those differences and, at times, even learn to appreciate them. &nbsp;As an aside, I disliked Shakespeare a great deal in college, though the fact was, I had not read much of his work. &nbsp;Then, an English class helped me understand what I was reading. &nbsp;I became a fan of the Bard and even taught a college class in Shakespearean tragedies. Teaching something almost always deepens our understanding and appreciation of that which we are teaching. &nbsp;The thing is, many of us are convinced that we...or our faith tradition, is the one and only truth. &nbsp;So convinced are we that we cannot or will not learn. &nbsp;Tolerance, in such circumstances may be a good thing because it can be a beginning step on a path that leads to true respect and love of each other regardless of our beliefs. <br /><br />When Blue laws were repealed, the sky did not fall down on our heads, but something did happen: &nbsp;People had to look at their own conscience when it came to shopping on a Sunday. And, I believe introspection is always a good thing...<br /><br />May we each build bridges toward a deeper understanding and appreciation of each other.<br /><br />Be well<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
