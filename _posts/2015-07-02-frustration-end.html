<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 13px;">With palms together,</div><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 13px;">Good Evening All,</div><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 13px; min-height: 16px;"><br /></div><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 13px;">It’s a little after 9:00 PM and outside I see clouds moving in over the mountains with an occasional lightening flash.&nbsp; At rest now, my heart is taking in the day, a day with frustrations, joy, intimacy, and business.&nbsp; It seemed as though at every turn there were issues with hanging the ink brush pictures.&nbsp; In the morning I will once again make an effort to complete the task. &nbsp;</div><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 13px; min-height: 16px;"><br /></div><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 13px;">I am a typical man: as things get in the way, frustration rises and swearing begins.&nbsp; Shukke Shin doesn’t approve of this, but then, neither do I.&nbsp; Still, there is frustration and there is swearing. It’s so, so automatic.&nbsp; Today, though, something changed.&nbsp; We had a session with our therapist and the frustrations came rolling out.&nbsp; What a relief it is to just let things come out. As we talked, laughter arose, another good thing. &nbsp;</div><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 13px; min-height: 16px;"><br /></div><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 13px;">When I discovered that the title cards to the paintings were not sticking and that I had gotten the wrong type of wire for the pictures, and that I had also forgotten the drill so I could not make starter holes on the frames…when I discovered all that, I decided in calmness to pack things up, get the right sort of wire and some material that will work to stick the tittle cards to the walls, and come back fresh in the morning.&nbsp; This friends, is actual progress.&nbsp; There was a time when I would simply go on auto pilot and fly around not resting till everything was addressed, fixed, or well on the way to being taken care of.</div><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 13px; min-height: 16px;"><br /></div><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 13px;">Practice is a good thing.&nbsp; Sitting quietly with my mind, holding it close, and letting it be what it is, can help immensely.&nbsp; What happens is this: through mindful practice we begin to see things as they happen and respond quickly making the necessary adjustments in mood, behavior, and demeanor in the process.&nbsp; It’s not that we are not frustrated, angry, or sad; its that we recognize these feelings and are able to create a space between them and our actions. I will be the first to admit I am not always able to do this, but I am able to recover from a bout of negative thoughts and feelings much more quickly than most. &nbsp;</div><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 13px; min-height: 16px;"><br /></div><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 13px;">You know, Zen asks nothing of us.&nbsp; The practice accepts us as we are.&nbsp; We are not going to hell in a hand basket for being human beings.&nbsp; The hell we fear is that which we create ourselves.&nbsp; Recognize this and you are almost home free. &nbsp;</div><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 13px; min-height: 16px;"><br /></div><br /><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 13px;">May you be a blessing in the universe.</div><div><br /></div></div>
