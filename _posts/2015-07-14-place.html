<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With respect to each of you,<br /><br />This evening I sat out under the stars, or what stars I could see since it is a cloudy evening here in Southern New Mexico. &nbsp;Seeing the stars is unnecessary, we know they are there and, if we had studied them, we know what they look like. &nbsp;Still, the act of sitting quietly out of doors is an act of mindful attention and love. <br /><br />We should love our home, this tiny speck of a planet in an infinite universe. &nbsp;It allows us to live, provides for us, and offers us a place in the vastness of space itself. &nbsp;Having a place is very important and is something we in the United States rarely consider, as we are Americans and don't necessarily see ourselves as needing (or having) a "place." <br /><br />Yet a "place" is one of the things in life we each seem to seek. &nbsp;We want to know who and what we are, as well as, where we fit in. &nbsp;We resist because we don't want to be "defined" by our sociological standing. &nbsp;We want to define ourselves and do so in a liquid way. &nbsp;Good for us, as that liquidity takes back to Zen where everything is understood to be liquid. &nbsp;Every being and everything is in a state of constant change. <br /><br />Personally, I am comfortable with my place, a place I have settled into and feel incredibly warm in. &nbsp;Sitting outside this evening I drew myself near to the edge of the universe. &nbsp;An edge that is just one breath away for each of us. &nbsp;To get there, just let go what what you think you know and open yourself to your greatest teacher, the universe itself.<br /><br />Be well,<br /><br /><br /></div>
