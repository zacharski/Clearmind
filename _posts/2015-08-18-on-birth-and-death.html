<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With palms together,<br /><br />From Shushogi: <i>The most important issue of all for Buddhists is the thorough clarification of the meaning of birth and death.  If the buddha is within birth and death, there is no birth and death. Simply understand that birth and death are in themselves nirvana; there is no birth and death to be hated nor nirvana to be desired.  Then, for the first time, we will be freed from birth and death.  To master this problem is of supreme importance. (As translated and published in Soto School Scriptures for Daily Services and Practice.)</i><br /><br />These are the precious words of Dogen Zenji. &nbsp;They can be comforting or terrifying or both. &nbsp;They are about as spiritual a koan as is possible; they are also a derivative from the Great Heart of Wisdom sutra.<br /><br />To apply a teaching from another of Master Dogen's works, the Genjokoan, birth has its own Dharma reality and death has its own Dharma reality. &nbsp;In birth there is just birth; in death there is just death. &nbsp;We typically don't like thinking about death, whereas, birth is something we tend to celebrate. &nbsp;Think about it or not, with what feels like the blink of an eye, there it is before us.<br /><br />I know as a young wounded soldier I never thought I would live this long, but now that I'm here, I'd rather stay, thank you very much! Dogen says, "if the buddha is<i> within </i>birth and death, there is no birth and death. &nbsp;One wonders just what this could possibly mean. &nbsp;Much like the Heart sutra is spoken from deep samadhi, and therefore with "Big Mind," nothing is separate.<br /><br />Grasping unification is key. &nbsp;If we are separate from each other, all things, and our own nature, then we can die. If, on the other hand, we have unified, which is to say, discarded our separateness, and experience oneness, then there can be no birth or death as these require duality to exist. In one there is no two, indeed, in one, there is no <i>one</i>. There is just thusness.<br /><br />Coming from this mind, birth ceases; death ceases, as both time and space collapse as separate experiences. We are a wave discovering it is water. The duality of the relative truth is what the Heart sutra suggests is what hinders the mind and thus allows us to fear.<br /><br />The sutra says, "no hindrance in the mind, no hindrance therefore no fear." &nbsp;What a wonderful mantra to hold close. <br /><br />Be well.</div>
