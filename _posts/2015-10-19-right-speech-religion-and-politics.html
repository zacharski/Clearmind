<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br />People say there are two areas of discussion friends ought not pursue: &nbsp;religion and politics. &nbsp;Yet, it seems to me these are two of the most important areas of our lives and they deserve civil dialogue.The key word here is “civil.” &nbsp;To be civil is to be respectful which requires listening and close attention. Today it seems nearly impossible to bear witness to such discussions. Talking heads and pundits have created a style of “dialogue” which is less dialogue than haranguing. Nothing is accomplished by one person interrupting, brow-beating, putting down, or competing. &nbsp;All these methods accomplish is to gain ratings on talk shows, polarize conversations and dumb-down our everyday ability to talk with one another. &nbsp;Recourse to “talking points” or catch phrases limits depth and discourages actual conversation.<br /><br />This loss of ability to discourse is a sorry state of affairs and a dangerous one. &nbsp;When civilized people cannot talk with one another nothing is learned; “opposing” camps remain polarized, and nothing changes. &nbsp;In fact, if anything, things get worse. <br /><br />One reason politics and religion seem off-limits is that they are, indeed, important. &nbsp;Not only are they important, they are near and dear to us. &nbsp;Our faith tradition is key to our moral understanding, politics enables our faith to be the undergirding of our choices and decisions related to our governance. &nbsp;Since these both are near and dear, we want to hold onto them. &nbsp;Yet, from a literal perspective, everything changes. Many of us refuse to understand and accept this truth so we suffer.<br /><br />The Buddha taught we should speak with mindfulness, care and compassion. &nbsp;He called this “Right Speech.” &nbsp;By right he didn’t quite mean incorrect or wrong. &nbsp;I believe he meant true, as in the line is true or the measure is true. &nbsp;It is what it says it is, and in speech, follows a middle way. &nbsp;To do this requires a few qualities: patience and forbearance, a willingness to listen, and a willingness to consider what is being said to which we will then respond. <br /><br />The next time we are in a discussion, let’s try to leave the sarcasm, cliched phrases, and desire to win out of the picture. &nbsp;It is said in the Zen world, moku rai or “silence is thunder.” &nbsp;Sometimes just listening helps as it allows those we are talking with to more fully outline their position. &nbsp;We shouldn’t be afraid of this or our opposing friend’s words (I believe much of the pundit’s tactics are derived from a basic fear that the other person will indeed have an opportunity to sway.) &nbsp;Our case should rest on its own merits without recourse to violating the precept against putting others down in order to elevate ourselves. &nbsp; <br /><br />Right speech is a challenge to us today, yet without it civil discourse is made impossible. The result is that we don’t learn, nor are we able to reach a solution to our differences. &nbsp;If we want a more peaceful community, perhaps this is one way to get there.</div>
