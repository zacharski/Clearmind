He would ask a simple straightforward sort of question such as, “are they the same or different?” With an answer of thirty blows regardless, ready made and to the point, just as any koan master might do.&nbsp; The point was everything is one in the same, both same and different.&nbsp; At this stage of my life as a Zen teacher all things seem to be flowing from and to this “same and different” place.</div><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(20, 25, 35); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; color: #141923; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; min-height: 16px;"><br /></div><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(20, 25, 35); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; color: #141923; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;">My sense? This is as it should be. Yet, I wonder.&nbsp; When we are young and making our mark in the world, it is of little help (or so we think)&nbsp; to be focused on anything but the brass ring and how to capture it. &nbsp; We have little time to step away from the ride, or don’t we?&nbsp; Often stepping away from the ride offers us a unique and (in my opinion) necessary perspective.&nbsp; Makes me wonder (again) just how important time in reflection is versus the “just do it” mentality of our “don’t wobble” Zensters.&nbsp; In any event, as we approach our practice intensive, know this: the two truths of the Buddha Way can, in fact, be held together as one.&nbsp; Its just our penchant for the naming of things that creates a separation.<span style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: white; font-family: Verdana; line-height: normal;">&nbsp;</span></div><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; color: white; font-family: Times; font-size: 16px; line-height: normal;"><br /></div><br /><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; color: white; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 20px; line-height: normal;"><br /></div><div><b><br /></b></div></div>
