<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="color: #141823; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px;">With respect to all.,</div><div style="color: #141823; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 6px;">I want to personally and publicly acknowledge my debt to two young monks who drove from Kansas City to Las Cruces in order to participate in our Rohatsu sesshin. Venerables&nbsp;<a class="profileLink" data-hovercard="/ajax/hovercard/user.php?id=100003714626154" href="https://www.facebook.com/errantabbot" style="color: #3b5998; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;">Sunyananda Dharma</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a class="profileLink" data-hovercard="/ajax/hovercard/user.php?id=100001065549617" href="https://www.facebook.com/thichtambi" style="color: #3b5998; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;">Thich Tam Bi</a>&nbsp;were extremely helpful to me as I injured my back muscles just as sesshin began. Their kindness and generosity of spirit were immensely helpful. Our Zen world is in dire need of repair and these two young ones are part of the repair team. You know, there are those who would exclude certain lineages, includig my own, yet practitioners from such lineages seem to be the few who are actually manifesting the Dharma in everyday life. I am, frankly, humbled by their presence and sickened by those who claim authenticity thru their patriarchs but show little of the Dharma in their actions.&nbsp;</div><div style="color: #141823; display: inline; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 6px;">My friend Rev.&nbsp;<a class="profileLink" data-hovercard="/ajax/hovercard/user.php?id=100009733323018" href="https://www.facebook.com/kobutsu.malone" style="color: #3b5998; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;">Kobutsu Malone</a>, for example, has done Zen a great service but has been kicked in the teeth for it. Here is a man, alone in the wildsa of Maine, who suffers daily both in terms of his physical body, but also in terms of his heart and spirit. Admittedly, he is a challenge, but consider where is anger and disenchantment comes from: a heart, pure of spirit, and dedicated to victims of predatory monks. It seems to me we really dso want to kill the messenger. What Kobutsu Malone has is an excellent crap detector. when approaching be aware he will tolerate no bullshit and robes, shaved heads and credentials will not save you...which is as it should be. Zen is, and always will be, a personal journey from the inside out and if we are not willing to begin from the inside, relying instead on credentials and brocade robes as indicators of anything at all, we are doomed to be failures in our practice and our authenticity as a Zen practitioner and not the least a human being.</div></div>
