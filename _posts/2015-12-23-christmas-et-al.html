<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="page" title="Page 1">   <div class="section" style="background-color: rgb(100.000000%, 100.000000%, 100.000000%);">    <div class="layoutArea">     <div class="column">      <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 11.000000pt;">With Palms Together, Good Morning Everyone, </span><br />       <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 11.000000pt;">Some of us in the United States dislike using the phrase “Season’s Greetings” or “Happy Holidays.” They believe we should use the phrase “Merry Christmas” instead as they see that Jesus is the “reason for the season.” Some, then, see this as part of a so-called “War on Christmas.” </span><br />       <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 11.000000pt;">Let’s see, to put this politely, I might say, “If there is a war on Christmas its hard to tell when surrounded by Christmas carols, lights, displays, sales, parking problems, and traffic jams.” Yet, we might look at it a different way and suggest that all of these things are, in fact, the war on Christmas itself. Yes, these have little to nothing to do with “the reason for the season.” What does a Christmas sale, for example, have to do with the birth of the founder of a major religion, a person held up to be the son of God, if not God himself? To me, as an outsider (I am not a Christian), I view the commercialization of Christmas as a direct attack on the meaning of the day itself. </span><br />       <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 11.000000pt;">Christmas does not stand alone during this time of year, the time of the waning sun. Hanukkah (Festival of Lights), Rohatsu (Enlightenment of the Buddha), the High Holy Days (Days of Repentance), and in Islam, Mawlid (birth of the prophet Mohammed). We might note that each of these seasonal “holy”days involve birth and death and the hope that abides in between. These holy days did not just pop up, they evolved over time and matched our emotional and psychological needs as they symbolize a basic and common human need and, as such, have become a deeply held part of us. </span><br />       <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 11.000000pt;">As winter approaches, we witness a transformation of our environment, leaves falling from trees, plants withering, things move more slowly as temperatures drop and water freezes. Our sun is with us less and less and for those who pay attention to such things, appears to fall further and further down the horizon. In ancient times these events were closely watched and greatly feared. We were reminded of our mortality, our pain and suffering. The ancients crafted belief systems and ceremonies around such seasonal changes in the hope of staving off death and bringing forth birth. These holidays, then, were crucial to our sense of well-being and safety. </span><br />       <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 11.000000pt;">Today however, we have lost touch with our enchanted and natural world. We have light and heat at the touch of a button. Our food is not scarce and comes neatly packaged and often our children have no sense as to where these packages come from or how they were produced. Its as if we left nature behind as we pursued (almost as a stampede) the near magical possibilities at the dawn of the age of enlightenment. </span><br />       <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 11.000000pt;">Losing touch with the natural world enables us to view it as just matter, life without spirit. Our children’s eyes are drawn to video games, devices, websites, movies, videos,and so forth. As adults and parents we, too, have lost touch with the natural cycles of the earth. We prize our technological progress which, in itself is not a bad thing, but when paired with a marginalizing of the natural world, becomes very dangerous. </span><br />      </div></div></div></div><br /><div class="page" title="Page 2">   <div class="section" style="background-color: rgb(100.000000%, 100.000000%, 100.000000%);">    <div class="layoutArea">     <div class="column">      <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 11.000000pt;">These days, these cold winter days, ought remind us of this spiritual rendering. They were designed to bring us back in touch with the world as it is. Let’s say, a re- enchantment of our lives and our relationship to the universe. When we light incense and offer it, as we buy or make a gift for others during these holidays, and as we sit facing a wall in Zazen, let us consider the real meaning of the seasonal cycles, let us bear witness to our species destruction of the environment. And on a personal, individual level, let us be aware of our lack of care and compassion for our own space and its conditioned relationship to the “larger” world. </span><br />       <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 11.000000pt;">If there is a “War on Christmas” that war is fed by our greed and enabled by our lack of understanding of our core reality. The Buddha woke up. He touched the ground with his finger tips and gave witness to the Earth itself. In this he saw the essential truth of each moment as gateways to liberation from life and death. May we each learn ways to re- enchant our world, bringing forth spirit and hope thru our practice. </span><br />       <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-size: 11.000000pt;">Yours, Daiho&nbsp;</span><br />      </div></div></div></div></div>
