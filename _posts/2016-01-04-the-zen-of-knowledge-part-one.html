We get to the truth by questioning it to be true. Therein arises faith.</div><div style="color: #454545; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; min-height: 14px;"><br /></div><div style="color: #454545; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">There is an observation common amongst Jews: Jews tend to answer questions with questions.&nbsp; It is always interesting when a question is answered with a question. The person asking the question may feel threatened so answers the returning question with defensiveness or the questioner understands the nature of the discussion is one of seeking the truth in which case he/she considers the response and allows feelings of defensiveness to flow away thus allowing further exploration.&nbsp;</div><div style="color: #454545; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; min-height: 14px;"><br /></div><div style="color: #454545; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">When we are convinced of the truth of something the larger truth eludes us as our conviction becomes an untested declaration.&nbsp;</div><div style="color: #454545; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; min-height: 14px;"><br /></div><div style="color: #454545; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">Someone in the various threads of my Facebook page asked the question, "how do we know?" In philosophy, especially the philosophy of science, this query takes us to a branch of philosophy called epistemology. It is a necessary question in the area of theory building.&nbsp; How do we know anything? &nbsp;</div><div style="color: #454545; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; min-height: 14px;"><br /></div><div style="color: #454545; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">Another, sometimes counter philosophical area, is ontology which is about "being."&nbsp; We might say somethings are known through our direct experience of them. Existentialists and phenomenologists may fall into this category.</div><div style="color: #454545; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; min-height: 14px;"><br /></div><div style="color: #454545; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">Theological issues often include epistemological questions related to a person's ontological or phenomenological knowledge.&nbsp; How do we know God?&nbsp; Is it even possible to know a proposed being who is believed to exist on an entirely different plane of existence as our own? I believe the Buddha argued it was both impossible to answer that question and that the question itself had no value because it did nothing to awaken us.</div><div style="color: #454545; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; min-height: 14px;"><br /></div><div style="color: #454545; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">Contemporary Zen Masters have suggested that one of the ways we may discover the truth is to abide in a "don't know" mind. Masters like Seung Sahn and Bernie Glassman are proponents of this, as is the Order of Clear Mind Zen. To abide in a "Don't Know Mind" is to deliberately set aside what we think we know so that what is in front of us has an opportunity to be seen as it is, directly, and without the filter of presumption.&nbsp; We develop such a mind through the practice of seated meditation and in the Rinzai school, koan work.&nbsp;</div><div style="color: #454545; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; min-height: 14px;"><br /></div><br /><div style="color: #454545; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">At this point, we might be asking ourselves, “So what?”&nbsp; In Part Two we will address that most important question of application. Be well Y’all</div></div>
