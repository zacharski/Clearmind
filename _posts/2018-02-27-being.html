Good Morning All,<br />
<br />
Back in the 60's ands 70's, "Becoming" was a popular notion. &nbsp;It felt as if we all were given the opportunity to be re-born into a state of freedom. &nbsp;This freedom was intoxicating. &nbsp;It was delicious. We felt free to explore our personal identity, meaning, and ultimate purpose. &nbsp;We explored our sexuality, our politics, our drugs, our religion and its spirituality. &nbsp;We explored music, dance, and art. It was a scary era in a sense, as we had no idea what the consequences of an unbridled freedom may mean.<br />
<br />
I discovered Zen in this mix, being introduced to it through martial arts and "The Way of Zen" by Alan Watts. &nbsp;Through karate i learned of Bodhidharma and the Shaolin temple. &nbsp;I learned about "mind like water." &nbsp;What truly fascinated me, though, was sitting zazen under a willow tree and in public parks. &nbsp;I often sat in the gardens of "Vizcaya" in Coconut Grove. &nbsp;It was a beautiful time, a time filled with hope and anxiety. <br />
<br />
I read about a philosophical conflict between "being" and "becoming." Like freedom and determination, I thought there ought to be no reason the two might not be two sides of the same coin, much like samsara and nirvana. What I have come to over the years is this: &nbsp;becoming is like wishful thinking, a delusion; being is all there is.<br />
<br />
It appears we are becoming only because we remember prior states. &nbsp;But in truth, each moment is complete as it is. While life may appear to be a string of frames that when looked at together form a movie, We ought not forget each frame is the entire universe within it. The memory of frames make us believe there was a yesterday and, hence, a tomorrow. &nbsp;So many of us are stuck in one or the other, so much so, that we diminish the value of this precise frame, the frame of now.<br />
<br />
Instead, might we look more deeply into this present moment frame, this frame of being. &nbsp;May we each in this moment the freedom of our true nature.<br />
