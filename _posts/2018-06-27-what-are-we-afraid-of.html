Lately I've had some dialogue with my friend Randy Harris, who leads our local "Great Conversation" on the topic of free speech v. hate speech. It seems to me it all boils down to the question, "do you feel safe?" In fact, many universities are now touting they are "safe" zones and, as a result, disallow speech that is "offensive" or "hurtful."&nbsp;</div>

Frankly, I think this is a grave mistake, especially in an institution of higher learning. It is a dangerous path to take as it d<span class="text_exposed_show" style="display: inline; font-family: inherit;">isallows alternative views so that we do not get to hear what our adversaries may be thinking or doing. Moreover, I believe it is an assault on the First Amendment. And for what? To protect our feelings? Are our feelings so important that we take away a speaker's right to speak?</span></div>

No. They are not. Our feelings are subjective, they are ours; deal with them.</div>
<div style="font-family: inherit; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 6px;">
Because they are subjective, the litmus test to remove a speaker, professor, or student, must also be. As we all know (I hope) all of us respond differently to perceptions. and all of us perceive differently. Since this is so, there simply cannot be an objective test regards so-called "hate speech."&nbsp;</div>
<div style="font-family: inherit; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 6px;">
When we do respond to speech that is hurtful or offensive, it ought not be related to our feelings being hurt, but rather to any threat that might be contained within it. Being vulnerable is a part of adult life. Adults don't cry to their mothers that their feelings were hurt. They make themselves stronger though directly dealing with the situation.</div>
