Hello All, as a frequent contributor both of blogs and money to Sweeping Zen, I am deeply concerned that the site will be taken down without notice. I urge you each to download your contribution as soon as possible. I have asked Adam if he would allow me and two friends to take over the site. He has declined that offer, including an offer to purchase it. As a result I will, with my colleagues, establish a new website of the same type. If you have an interest in contributing your articles, please contact me at daihoroshi@gmail.com thank you</div>
