<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
Yesterday I spent some time talking with two friends at Milagros coffee shop. Our discussion rambled a bit, as discussions often do, but settled on a most interesting challenge: is it possible for a speaker in a school to be inspiring without emotional investment? And is such investment manipulative? What role does inspiration have in education anyway?<br />
<br />
It seems to me inspiration comes from and through a speakers life. And what our young ones (and elders) need is a sense of inspiration. I don’t seem to care much if the speech is emotionally charged and will manipulate, what I care about is motivation. Getting us to look into something, dig deeply into it, requires motivation and motivation is often gained through inspiration. <br />
<br />
The concern was that our audience may not have the cognitive skills to take apart and critically examine what’s being presented and also that the speaker may not have done the same and as a result, allows biases to enter without examination, save, in afterthoughts.<br />
<br />
So, do we require inspiration to aid our motivation? Should a highly controversial speaker be turned away due to toxic language or ideas? Do we have the critical skills to examine a speakers words?<br />
<br />
Given our current political situation, I’m inclined to say we don’t. &nbsp;So where does that put us?<br />
<br />
Yours,</div>
