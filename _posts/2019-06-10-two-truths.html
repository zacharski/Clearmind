<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
<div style="caret-color: rgb(28, 30, 33); color: #1c1e21; font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;.SFNSText-Regular&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px;">

<div style="caret-color: rgb(28, 30, 33); color: #1c1e21; font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;.SFNSText-Regular&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 6px;">
Buddhism teaches there are two truths: the relative and the absolute. One is particular the other relative. We live in both.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="caret-color: rgb(28, 30, 33); color: #1c1e21; font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;.SFNSText-Regular&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 6px;">
When aware of the relative, we are each separate beings living on a particular planet in a particular solar system. When aware of the absolute, there is no us, no planet, no solar system: nothing is separate, all is one. Both “inter-are.”&nbsp;</div>
<div class="text_exposed_show" style="caret-color: rgb(28, 30, 33); color: #1c1e21; display: inline; font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;.SFNSText-Regular&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">
<div style="font-family: inherit; margin-bottom: 6px;">
What does this have to do with anything at all? Everything. Derived from the absolute, our morality guides us. Our oneness teaches us to do no harm. Our relative enables us to live and survive. I am drinking a cup of coffee, and in doing so I am drinking the beans grown in Guatemala or Brazil; I am enabled to do this as a result of the many lives and many hands that brought this coffee into existence and to my table.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="font-family: inherit; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 6px;">
When in the absolute all of this is clear and yet dissolves. When in the relative it is important to honor those hands and lives for they have provided us.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="font-family: inherit; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 6px;">
One might say living in the absolute is living in awakening. One might further say that living in the relative is living in delusion. Both would be true, yet, these distinctions themselves are meaningless. Our teaching is to live without attaching to either, but instead accepting both as the true nature of our reality.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="font-family: inherit; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 6px;">
This is what it means to “float like a duck.” The storm comes and we float. The storm resolves and we float. We know there is no storm and there is no calm. There is just this, what’s in your moment right now.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="font-family: inherit; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 6px;">
So allow the storm, but don’t be guided by it; allow the calm, but don’t be deceived by it. This is the Great Way.</div>
