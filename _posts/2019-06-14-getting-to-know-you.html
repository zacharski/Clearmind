The world is such an interesting place. Over the last two days two close friends and I rode our Harley’s from Las Cruces to Salado, Texas, a distance of 672 miles. &nbsp;Throughout the ride we were greeted warmly by interested locals at gas stations and restaurants. &nbsp;Its always curious to me how that works. &nbsp;We stop. &nbsp;People turn their heads at the sounds of the bikes. &nbsp;They see bikers with “cuts” and, while one might think they’d be intimidated, they often are just as likely, if not more likely, to ask us where we are going and where we are from. &nbsp;A smile here goes a very long way. &nbsp;Soon we are in a greart conversation about travel, motorcycles or veteran issues. American can be a great country. &nbsp;We have great people. &nbsp;All that seems necessary is a warm smile and willingness to talk and tell stories. <br />
<br />
The ride, sometimes on the Interstate, sometimes on the back roads through the Texas hill country, is beautiful. &nbsp;We see a nation on the move: business, vacation, or just “Sunday” drives, and all the while yielding a willingness to engage and get to know each other. &nbsp;We stopped at a “parking spece” off I-10. &nbsp;We were soon joined by a family we had seen together at a gas station a few miles back. &nbsp;The children were fascinated by locusts that seemed to live there. &nbsp;We talked about them. How hard is that?<br />
<br />
Yet, in the cities, such things are much more private affairs. &nbsp;Too bad it seems to me, as when we do talk with one another we find common ground and mutual interests. &nbsp;All it talks is a warm smile and the courage to take the risk of introducing oneself to total strangers.<br />
<br />
I look forward to getting back on the road again, but not before getting to know the fine folk in Salado.<br />
<br />
May we each enjoy the company of one another!<br />
<br />
Be well,<br />
