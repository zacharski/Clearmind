<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
Gassho Y'all,<br />
<br />
This morning over coffee Shukke and I talked about Zen, what it is exactly.&nbsp; Many folks including renowned teachers answer the question talking about zazen and other forms. And while that is satisfactory, I find it leads many to believe the forms are the practice, but the forms, dear readers, are not Zen, they are practice to be Zen.&nbsp; And in that practice, our eyes open. But do not mistake:&nbsp; practice apart from life, seen as separate from lived experience, is a duality.<br />
<br />
Life, with a mind that is present, is Zen: nothing special. As we sip our coffee, do our dishes, put one foot in front of another, and do so fully and completely, that is Zen. <br />
Bowing practice, eating practice, walking and sitting practice, these are both Zen (when done with eyes open) and the practice that gets us there. How do we open our hearts if we fear touching it? How do wechange our response in situations if we are iunaware of the need?<br />
<br />
Zen "practice," then,&nbsp; is a gate and the field beyond when we <br />realize the dualities within us and begin to let them fall away.</div>
