With palms together,<br />Good Morning All,<br />
Sometimes change, a constant in our lives, is a challenge. Hell, most of the time it is. Yet, because it is a constant, it is something we must deal with.&nbsp; The Buddha taught life is suffering, but only because life is change; and we resist change since we are so invested in keeping it the same. <br />
The Buddha taught us the following:<br />
"I am of the nature to grow old. There is no way to escape growing old.<br />
I am of the nature to have ill health. There is no way to escape ill health.<br />
I am of the nature to die. There is no way to escape death.<br />All that is dear to me and everyone I love are of the nature to change...<br />
My actions are my only true belongings. I cannot escape the consequences of my actions... "<br />
So, in the face of these truths how do we live?<br />
The essential nature of these five remembrances is change. To live with change is not easy.&nbsp; We must be willing to loosen the grip of our attachments to things. It is that grip that is our suffering.&nbsp; Perhaps one way is to re-frame change away from loss to gift.&nbsp; We we let go of one thing, another arises: closing one door allows for the opening of another and in each a change occurs.&nbsp; We might call it transformative.<br />
Change then, allows us to grow, to transform our lives into something new and different and, hopefully, better.&nbsp; So, let us not fear change or deny it, but rather, let us welcome it and embrace it as a necessary aspect of the f;low of life.<br />
Be well.<br />Daiho</div>
