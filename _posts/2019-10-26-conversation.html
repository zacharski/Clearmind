With palms together,<br />Good Afternoon Everyone,<br />
It is late afternoon here in Las Cruces, New Mexico.&nbsp; Our sky is sunny and its about 70 degrees F. A good day to be outside.&nbsp; So, this morning after working some on our "water feature" I rode my Harley down to the Farmers Market and sat with my friend Randy Harris. We talked, once again, about time. A few others joined in.&nbsp; It is fascinating how hungry people seem to be for a good conversation. <br />
After returning home I finished our water feature and talked with my neighbor Luis. Luis will be moving soon; I will miss him.&nbsp; He is from Venezuela, and sharp as a tack and filled with kindness and generosity.&nbsp; We often talk over the stone wall that separates our yards.<br />
Good conversation is easy.&nbsp; One has simply to be open and inviting, listen, and respond as a human being. This seems so difficult today for most of us, I think.&nbsp; It seems hard&nbsp; just to get past the weather or sports or some other innocuous subject. What I have found though is if I introduce a topic that requires some reflection I either get an enthusiastic reponse or vacant eyes. <br />
It has been said that a Master listens and speaks little.&nbsp; I believe, however, that one must share oneself in a conversation.&nbsp; Knowing we are each human beings with our own stories, shortcomings and virtues tends to disarm and encourage a degree of reciprocity. <br />
Let us each not be afraid to talk to people; they are, afterall, everywhere!&nbsp; <br />
Be well,<br />
