<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
Enjoying my lunch reading about time. An old looking man came up to me, sat down, and said I looked like a peaceful person￼￼. Telling me he was from New York City and he was “seriously f*cked up.”<br />
<br />
I listened to his lament...too much drinking, too many marriages, and on and on. He wanted to know how to be at peace. I said, that’s within him. He asked what to do . I said nothing, just stop beating himself with a stick. He said he couldn’t do that. So I said get rid of the stick and use a feather.<br />
<br />
He smiled, got up and walked away.</div>
