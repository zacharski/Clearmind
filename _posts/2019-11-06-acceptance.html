With palms together,<br />

Let's see, this morning I must have some scans done.&nbsp; This afternoon someone's coming to check our water softener and someone else will deliver a walker. Yes, I need a walker.&nbsp; It seems my ability to walk is compromised a bit. Getting old ain't for sissies they say, but the hard part is acceptance in the face of facts.&nbsp; <br />
Acceptance that everything is change, that nothing, absolutely nothing remains the same is both a Buddhist principle, but also simply a fact of life. It is the essence of the Second of the Buddha's Four Noble Truths, that the cause of our suffering is "attachment," or as I like to think of it, "investment."&nbsp; The more we asre inversted in keeping something, the more we suffer, why? Because everything changes. Yet, the Buddha offered hope. The Third Noble Truth is that there is a way to end suffering and that way is the Eightfold Noble Path.<br />
I'm not going to name the eight folds, but will say their essence is "the Middle Way."&nbsp; And what is that?&nbsp; Easy, sort of. Not falling prey to extremes. Knowing something we value will change and accepting that truth is a mature and wise view: it allows us to love with an open hand. Hold on, but not too tight. <br />
AA has a phrase, "Let go, let God."&nbsp; I would say, let go and allow your true nature to guide you. What is that?&nbsp; Practice to find out.<br />
Be well,<br />
