Let's talk about this:<br />from Dictionary.com<br />
"What does woke mean?" <br />"Woke means being conscious of racial discrimination in society and other forms of oppression and injustice. In mainstream use, woke can also more generally describe someone or something as being "with it.""<br />
A term now popular amongst our social justice warriors, "woke" is a word that separates those awake to social justice and racism from those who, they may claim, are not.&nbsp; My sense is this sort of thing does more harm than good as it is just another form of prejudicial discrimination.&nbsp; <br />
If someone does not shasre our view of what social justice is we can simply dismiss him or her as not "woke."&nbsp; Yet, he or she may very well be aware of social justice and believe differently than we as to how to address it.&nbsp; Or quite possibly we don't like his or her way. So, if we are not on the same page, define things in the same way, then, I suspect we are not "woke."&nbsp; <br />
Does this division help us in any way at all?<br />
