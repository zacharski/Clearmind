With palms together,<br />Good Day All,<br />
As we suffer through our nation's nightmare of division, conflict, and dashed dreams. I believe it is critical to release the reins of True Belief. Those of us who feel strongly about the state of our nation, if not the world, live on both sides of this great divide. As we reinforce our positions with facts and figures, we do so without due regard for our nation as a whole.<br />
Which one of us actually thinks about the greater good?&nbsp; Which one of us could articulate what the good may be?&nbsp; And do so without denigrating the "other side"? <br />
One of the ten grave precepts is not to elivate ourselves at the expense of others. In this climate it seems to me that violating this precpt is both common and accepted, much like the changing motres of our society.&nbsp; I confess I am as guilty as the next guy in posting items that denigrate Mr Trump and his followers.&nbsp; I do so out of a need to help people understand what I believe to be "the error of their ways." How presumptive asnd arrogent, I am.&nbsp; As are most of us today in these United States.<br />
We say, in the Buddha Way, there are three poisons: greed, hatred, and delusion, and that these can be met with generosity, love, and wisdom. Today we have allowed ourselves to become prey to these three toxic characteristics.&nbsp; How unfortunate.<br />
Giving when we have so little ourselves, loving those who hate us, and developing wisdom to replace the dualities of delusion, is seriously difficult.&nbsp; Yet practice we must if we are to ever hope to return our nation to sanity. A major aspect of this practice is to learn to see a much bigger picture which includes those we may disagree with<br />
Our nation is in our hands; let us use them to build rather than destroy.<br />
