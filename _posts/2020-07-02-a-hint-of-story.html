Another day in solitude. I did have one student who dropped by to talk. We sat at least ten feet apart outside on the patio. I also did a radio interview for the community radio station. So, not a bad day all tolled.<br />

The show was about an essay I wrote concerning a shift in our paradigm. A shift away from the personal to the digital and virtual realities we are finding ourselves living in. &nbsp;I’ll post that article shortly.
