Good Morning All,&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>This morning I'll be meeting with Randy Harris to discuss the topic for a radio show we will record later today for broadcast tomorrow.&nbsp; We will be talking about the notion of a shift in paradigm from an analog, paper and pencil, set of values to a high tech virtual reality paradigm.&nbsp; Take a listen Monday morning at 7:00 AM on KTAL, lccommunityradio.org. 101.5 FM</div>
