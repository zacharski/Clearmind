<p>&nbsp;A lot on my mind today. And as a result a few changes.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>I have decided to withdraw from public life. I have stepped away from the radio show and will only use social media to show art work and offer teachings in the Zen tradition. I will continue training my current students but will not accept new students.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Fundamentally, I am retiring to focus my attention on my practice and life as a priest. &nbsp;Treating my residence as my monastery, containing myself to my zendo and library with occasional use of the kitchen and living room.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>May you each be a blessing in the universe.</p>
