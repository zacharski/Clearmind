<p>&nbsp;With palms together,</p><p><br /></p><p>Recently I decided, rather abruptly, to resign my teaching position at the Order. Our new Head Teacher is Rev Marshall Daishin Tucker. I will not go into the particulars but suffice it to say my energy reserves are just not up to it. So, I will contain myself to teaching via this blog and other venues such as public lectures, radio interviews and the like.</p><p><br /></p><p>With this I will remain Abbot of the Order and work with our Executive Committee to take us into this new year. We are meeting this morning to discuss possibilities and forge a direction. My sense is we have two major tasks: first, develop our organizational structure and second, work to build our membership. To support that last goal, I am suggesting we develop a membership application, policies regarding membership, and assign a membership director.</p><p><br /></p><p>I will keep you posted as things unfold.</p><p><br /></p><p>Be well, y'all</p><p>Daiho</p>
