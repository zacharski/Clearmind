<p>&nbsp;With palms together,&nbsp;</p><p>Sitting outside, it is 33 degrees. The fresh air is brisk to say the least. Zazen out of doors is nothing special really, the Buddha did it all of his life. Yet we westerners rarely take the Buddha’s way. I’ve heard students say it is uncomfortable, as if comfort is important to the practice. It is not.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>What’s important to the practice is the practice itself regardless of conditions. Sit like a mountain: all ancestors have taught this. Even if, as in my case, the mountain itself is unstable. Easy?&nbsp; No. Necessary? Yes. To be a buddha, is to be a buddha in all directions and in all times.</p><p><br /></p><p>Gassho&nbsp;</p>
