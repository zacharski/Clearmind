<p>&nbsp;Dear Readers,</p><p><br /></p><p>For the record, I oppose abortion as a general rule since I support life. I also support the sanctity of privacy, freedom of choice, and a society where government has no business in our bedroom. I this regard, then, I support freedom of choice when it involves itself in our lives.&nbsp; We do not criminally charge those who attempt suicide, nor do we issue Social Security and Medicaid cards to those not yet born.&nbsp; So, I wonder of what use is a birth certificate?&nbsp; Why not issue an embryo certificate instead?</p><p><br /></p><p>Just a thought.</p><p>Daiho</p>
